4,Study on fundamental usage of CloudSim simulator and algorithms of resource allocation in cloud computing,"Cloud computing is an internet-based pool of heterogeneous resources. The development of Cloud is scalable and reliable to make availability of resources when required to online users. Resources are provided as a service on demand with payment done on use basis. Nowadays, for less cost and maximize resource utilization, mainly computing is done on Cloud. Cloud simulator is a collection of java classes that provides simulation of concepts of cloud computing. Cloudlet scheduling is one of the most important task in cloud computing.

2,Optimization of performance and scheduling of HPC applications in cloud using cloudsim and scheduling approach,"Cloud computing is emerging as a promising alternative to supercomputers for some High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications. Cloud computing is an essential component of the back bone of the Internet of Things (IoT). Clouds are needed to support huge numbers of interactions with varying quality requirements. Hence, Service quality will be a vital differentiator among cloud providers. In order to differentiate themselves from their competitors, cloud providers should offer best services that meet customers' expectations. A quality model can be used to represent, measure and compare the quality of the providers, such that a mutual understanding can be established among clouds take holders. With cloud as an additional deployment option, HPC users and providers faces the challenges of dealing with highly heterogeneous resources, where the variability spans across a wide range of processor configurations, interconnects, virtualization environments, and pricing models. HPC applications are increasingly being used in academia and laboratories for scientific research and in industries for business and analytics. Cloud computing offers the benefits of virtualization, elasticity of resources and elimination of cluster setup cost and time to HPC applications users. Effort was taken for holistic viewpoint to answer the questions — why and who should choose cloud for HPC, for what applications and how the cloud can be used for HPC? Comprehensive performance and cost evaluation and analysis of running a set of HPC applications on a range of platforms, varying from supercomputers to clouds was carried out. Further, performance of HPC applications is improved in cloud by optimizing HPC applications' characteristics for cloud and cloud virtualization mechanisms for HPC. In this paper, a novel heuristics for online application-aware job scheduling in multi-platform environments is presented. Experimental results and Simulations using CloudSim show that current clouds cannot substitute supercomputers but can effectively complement them.","International Conference on Informatics, IoT, and Enabling Technologies",2017,10.1109/iciota.2017.8073634,"D.

1,A cloud simulation based environment for multi-disciplinary collaborative simulation and optimization,"Multi-disciplinary virtual prototype (MDVP) based on modeling and computer simulation technology has been applied in a wide range of engineering applications, especially the design, testing and evaluation of complex products. Generally, a large set of parameters need to be optimized to improve the performance of the prototype, which comprises a number of heterogeneous models from multiple domains. This calls for numerous collaborative simulation experiments in heterogeneous computing environments, which are difficult to build and configure. Cloud simulation is a promising solution with the extremely large resource pool and dynamic construction of virtual computing environments. Thus this paper firstly proposed an optimization framework of MDVP which formulated the domain models, optimizer and the distributed interactive environment on cloud for multi-disciplinary engineers. Then we designed the procedure for conducting parallel optimization of MDVP in the cloud simulation system by con-current execution of MDVP simulation system. The method proposed in the paper has been applied to a MDVP in the aerospace industry, which indicates that the proposed method can support an efficient engineering methodology that can transform the traditional centralized, serial simulation optimization to the distributed collaborative and parallel simulation optimization.",International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design,2017,10.1109/cscwd.2017.8066735,"Mei Wang, Tingyu Lin, Lichao Wei, Chao Ruan, Liqin Guo, C.

5,Adaptive cloud simulation using position based fluids,"In this paper, we propose a method for the simulation of clouds using particles exclusively. The method is based on position based fluids, which simulates fluids using position constraints. To reduce the simulation time, we have used adaptive splitting and merging to concentrate computation on regions where it is most needed. When clouds are formed, particles are split so as to add more details to the generated cloud surface and when they disappear, particles are merged back. We implement our adaptive method on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to accelerate the computation. While the splitting portion is easily parallelizable, the merge portion is not. We develop a simple algorithm to address this problem and achieve reasonable simulation times. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Comput. Animat. Virtual Worlds,2015,10.1002/cav.1657,"Y.

18,EdgeCloudSim: An environment for performance evaluation of Edge Computing systems,"Edge Computing is a fast growing field of research covering a spectrum of technologies such as Cloudlets, Fog Computing and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). Edge Computing involves technically more sophisticated setup when compared with the pure Cloud Computing and pure Mobile Computing cases since both computational and network resources should be considered simultaneously. In that respect, it provides a larger design space with many parameters rendering a variety of novel approaches feasible. Given the complexity, Edge Computing designs deserve scientific scrutiny for sound assessment of their feasibility. However, despite increasing research activity, this field lacks a simulation tool compatible with the requirements. Starting from available simulators a significant programming effort is required to obtain a simulation tool meeting the actual needs. To decrease the barriers, a new simulator tool called EdgeCloudSim streamlined for Edge Computing scenarios is proposed in this work. EdgeCloudSim builds upon CloudSim to address the specific demands of Edge Computing research and support necessary functionality in terms of computation and networking abilities. To demonstrate the capabilities of EdgeCloudSim an experiment setup based on different edge architectures is simulated and the effect of the computational and networking system parameters on the results are depicted.",International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing,2017,10.1109/fmec.2017.7946405,"Cem Ersoy, Cagatay Sonmez, Atay Ozgovde",16.5,1

23,Usage of Cloud Computing Simulators and Future Systems For Computational Research,"Cloud Computing is an Internet based computing, whereby shared resources, software and information, are provided to computers and devices on demand, like the electricity grid. Currently, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) are used as a business model for Cloud Computing. Nowadays, the adoption and deployment of Cloud Computing is increasing in various domains, forcing researchers to conduct research in the area of Cloud Computing globally. Setting up the research environment is critical for the researchers in the developing countries to evaluate the research outputs. Currently, modeling, simulation technology and access of resources from various university data centers has become a useful and powerful tool in cloud computing research.

244,Investigating Effects of Animated 3D Point Cloud Simulations on Emotional Responses,"3D simulations are increasingly used in virtual reality laboratory experiments for measuring emotional responses in order to gain a deeper understanding of the perception and judgment of visual landscape quality. Ensuring that these simulations are valid for the intended task is crucial. We demonstrate how we tested animations of a flight into 3D point cloud models of urban areas on the subject of their possible influence on people’s arousal response. Furthermore, we provide insights into the technical development and implementation of these simulations. The simulations were set up in a game engine and presented on a head-mounted display. In the experiment, one group first saw the areas in a bird’s-eye view followed by a flight down to a pedestrian view. The other group was shown the pedestrian view only. During the presentation, arousal was assessed by measuring skin conductance response and with the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) questionnaire. Based on the results we can conclude that the animated flight and the perceived movement that comes with it does not affect the measured arousal response signals. However, further studies are needed to understand the response patterns to the different urban areas. Regarding the animated landscape simulation, the level of detail management of 3D point clouds needs further enhancement in order to provide more consistent transitions between the abstract landscape representation during the flight and the highly detailed perspective at ground level. Alternative approaches such as a combination of 360° videos for the flight and 3D point cloud simulations should be tested.",,2020,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103903,"A.

228,CloudSimSDN: Modeling and Simulation of Software-Defined Cloud Data Centers,"Software-Defined Networking not only addresses the shortcoming of traditional network technologies in dealing with frequent and immediate changes in cloud data centers but also made network resource management open and innovation-friendly. To further accelerate the innovation pace, accessible and easy-to-learn testbeds are required which estimate and measure the performance of network and host capacity provisioning approaches simultaneously within a data center. This is a challenging task and is often costly if accomplished in a physical environment. Thus, a lightweight and scalable simulation environment is necessary to evaluate the network allocation capacity policies while avoiding such a complicated and expensive facility. This paper introduces CloudSimSDN, a simulation framework for SDN-enabled cloud environments based on CloudSim. This paper develops and presents the overall architecture and features of the framework and provides several use cases. Moreover, we empirically validate the accuracy and effectiveness of CloudSimSDN through a number of simulations of a cloud-based three-tier web application.","2015 15th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing",2015,10.1109/ccgrid.2015.87,"R.

42,Octree‐based point cloud simulation to assess the readiness of highway infrastructure for autonomous vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are anticipated to supersede human drivers with an expectation of improved safety and operation. Since current infrastructure is designed based on the constraints caused by human drivers, it must be reassessed for autonomous driving compatibility. Recently, representatives from the infrastructure owners/operators (IOOs), automotive industry, and academia have advocated for new approaches to prepare roadways for the deployment of AVs over the next decade. Following these recommendations, this paper proposes a novel, simulation‐based approach for the assessment of highways ""readiness"" for AVs using 3D point cloud data. The proposed method uses octrees to perform volumetric queries for potential obstructions within an AV sensory field. The proposed approach is compared to a state‐of‐the‐art raycasting approach. Consequently, available sight distances and maximum safe speed limits based on road and AV characteristics are proposed. Finally, a discussion of the potential mitigation measures at the locations with limited sight distances is presented.",Comput. Aided Civ.

48,Data-driven cloud simulation architecture for automated flexible production lines: application in real smart factories,"In recent years, more manufacturing enterprises are building automated flexible production lines (AFPLs) to satisfy the dynamic and diversified demand. Currently, static planning methods can hardly meet the requirements of the dynamic resource allocation for AFPLs. The technologies of the digital twin can help solve dynamic problems. Therefore, we propose a data-driven cloud simulation architecture for AFPLs in smart factories. First, we design a cloud simulation platform as the architecture foundation. Second, we use the data-driven modelling and simulation method to achieve automated modelling. Third, we implement the system on the cloud using Java, MySQL, and the Anylogic platform, and verify the efficiency of the proposed method by experiments in the real workshop of a 3C (Computer, Communication, Consumer electronics) company. The experimental results show the proposed architecture can support the real-time resource allocation decisions to maximise the throughput in AFPLs. This paper makes contributions by proposing an architecture realising automatic modelling and data-driven simulation first in the cloud simulation environment, and filling the gap of dynamic resource allocation in the research of AFPLs.",International Journal of Production Research,2021,10.1080/00207543.2021.1931977,"C.

210,CloudSimSDN‐NFV: Modeling and simulation of network function virtualization and service function chaining in edge computing environments,"Software‐defined networking (SDN) has evolved and brought an innovative paradigm shift in computer networks by utilizing a programmable software controller with open protocols. Network functions, previously served on dedicated hardware, have shifted to network function virtualization (NFV) that enabled functions to be virtualized and provisioned dynamically upon generic hardware. In addition to NFV, edge computing utilizes the edge resources close to end‐users, which can reduce the end‐to‐end service delay and the network traffic volume. Although these innovative technologies gained significant attention from both academia and industry, there are limited tools and simulation frameworks for the effectiveness evaluation in a repeatable and controllable manner. Furthermore, large‐scale experimental infrastructures are expensive to setup and difficult to maintain. Even if they are created, they are not available or accessible for the majority of researchers throughout the world. In this paper, we propose a framework for simulating NFV functionalities in both edge and cloud computing environments. In addition to the basic network functionalities supported by SDN in CloudSimSDN, we added new NFV features, such as virtualized network functions allocation, migration, and autoscaling with the support of corresponding network functionalities, such as flow load balancing, rerouting, and service function chaining (SFC) maintenance. We evaluated our simulation framework with autoscaling and placement policies for SFC in the integrated edge and cloud computing environments. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in measuring and evaluating the end‐to‐end delay, response time, resource utilization, network traffic, and power consumption with different algorithms in each scenario.","Software, Practice & Experience",2019,10.1002/spe.2755,"Jungmin Son, Tianzhang He, R.

However, the distributed organization introduces a new type of decision making problem for placing and executing functions to a specific cloud server. In order to handle the problem, we extended a well-known cloud computing simulator, CloudSim. The extended CloudSim enables users to define FaaS functions with various characteristics and service level objectives (SLOs), place them across geo-distributed cloud servers, and evaluate per-function performance.

202,Investigation of Cloud Scheduling Algorithms for Resource Utilization Using CloudSim,"Compute Cloud comprises a distributed set of High-Performance Computing (HPC) machines to stipulate on-demand computing services to remote users over the internet. Clouds are capable enough to provide an optimal solution to address the ever-increasing computation and storage demands of large scientific HPC applications. To attain good computing performances, mapping of Cloud jobs to the compute resources is a very crucial process. Currently we can say that several efficient Cloud scheduling heuristics are available, however, selecting an appropriate scheduler for the given environment (i.e., jobs and machines heterogeneity) and scheduling objectives (such as minimized makespan, higher throughput, increased resource utilization, load balanced mapping, etc.) is still a difficult task. In this paper, we consider ten important scheduling heuristics (i.e., opportunistic load balancing algorithm, proactive simulation-based scheduling and load balancing, proactive simulation-based scheduling and enhanced load balancing, minimum completion time, Min-Min, load balance improved Min-Min, Max-Min, resource-aware scheduling algorithm, task-aware scheduling algorithm, and Sufferage) to perform an extensive empirical study to insight the scheduling mechanisms and the attainment of the major scheduling objectives. This study assumes that the Cloud job pool consists of a collection of independent and compute-intensive tasks that are statically scheduled to minimize the total execution time of a workload. The experiments are performed using two synthetic and one benchmark GoCJ workloads on a renowned Cloud simulator CloudSim. This empirical study presents a detailed analysis and insights into the circumstances requiring a load balanced scheduling mechanism to improve overall execution performance in terms of makespan, throughput, and resource utilization. The outcomes have revealed that the Sufferage and task-aware scheduling algorithm produce minimum makespan for the Cloud jobs. However, these two scheduling heuristics are not efficient enough to exploit the full computing capabilities of Cloud virtual machines.",Computing and informatics,2019,10.31577/cai_2019_3_525,"Muhammad Aleem, A.

217,Cluster-based Analysis of Multi-Parameter Distributions in Cloud Simulation Ensembles,"The proposed approach enables a comparative visual exploration of multi-parameter distributions in time-varying 3D ensemble simulations. To investigate whether dominant trends in such distributions occur, we consider the simulation elements in each dataset—per ensemble member and time step—as elements in the multi-dimensional parameter space, and use t-SNE to project these elements into 2D space. To find groups of elements with similar parameter values in each time step, the resulting projections are clustered via k-Means. Since elements with similar data values can be disconnected in one single projection, we compute an ensemble of projections using multiple t-SNE runs and use evidence accumulation to determine sets of elements that are stably clustered together. We build upon per-cluster multi-parameter distribution functions to quantify cluster similarity, and merge clusters in different ensemble members. By applying the proposed approach to a time-varying ensemble, the temporal development of clusters, and in particular their stability over time can be analyzed. We apply this approach to analyze a time-varying ensemble of 3D cloud simulations. The visualizations via t-SNE, parallel coordinate plots and scatter plot matrices show dependencies between the simulation results and the simulation parameters used to generate the ensemble, and they provide insight into the temporal ensemble variability regarding the major trends in the multi-parameter distributions.","International Symposium on Vision, Modeling, and Visualization",2019,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864901,"Josef Stumpfegger, Alexander Kumpf, R.

171,Scheduler hierarchies to aid peta-scale cloud simulations with DISSECT-CF,"IaaS cloud simulators are frequently used for evaluating new scheduling practices. Unfortunately, most of these simulators scarcely allow the evaluation of larger-scale cloud infrastructures (i.e., with physical machine counts over a few thousand). Thus, they are seldom applicable for evaluating infrastructures available in commercial cloud settings (e.g., users mostly do not wait for simulations to complete in such settings). DISSECT-CF was shown to be better scaling than several other simulators, but peta-scale infrastructures with often millions of CPU cores were out of scope for DISSECT-CF as well. This paper reveals a hierarchical scheduler extension of DISSECT-CF that not only allows its users to evaluate peta-scale infrastructure behaviour, but also opens possibilities for analysing new multi-cloud scheduling techniques. The paper then analyses the performance of the extended simulator through large-scale synthetic workloads and compares its performance to DISSECT-CF's past behaviour. Based on the analysis, the paper concludes with recommended simulation setups that will allow the evaluation of new schedulers for peta-scale clouds in a timely fashion (e.g., within minutes).",,2015,10.1287/moor.2014.0694,Gábor Kecskeméti,2.4,1
133,A Comparative Analysis of Cloud Simulators,"Cloud Computing is a new paradigm which allows individuals and organizations to purchase resources like compute, storage, networking etc as a utility with minimum human intervention. According to recent surveys more than half of the large to medium size organizations have already migrated to the cloud. Despite of providing resources as a utility and its wide spread acceptance in the IT community, cloud computing is still at its prime and poses many challenges like automated service provisioning, virtual machine migration, server consolidation, energy management, traffic analysis, data security, software frameworks which needs considerable amount of research to stabilize. Conducting research on live cloud environments for individuals or small institutions is very difficult due to the costs involved in setting up a cloud.

186,Simulating the Resource Freeing Attack: Using Cloudsim Simulator,"Virtualization is a technique to make the cloud computations secure. This technique can reduce the costs and increase the reliability of systems by means of sharing the physical resources between several VMs (Virtual Machines). However, virtualized environments are vulnerable to some security issues such as lack of performance isolation. These days, using the virtualization as a technique is growing slowly in large organizations. Despite these advantages, virtualizations have created several security challenges. So, the main concern of virtualization service providers and their customers is how to detect and encounter these security challenges. In this research, the resource freeing attack is selected among all available virtualization attacks because of its simplicity and its drastic effects. Resource freeing attack causes an unfair resource distribution among VMs. We use Cloudsim as a powerful cloud simulation toolkit to implement resource freeing attack. After simulating the attack, the CPU's efficiency, response time diagrams, and the obtained bandwidth are measured. The simulation results show the significant changes in VM behavior after occurring the attack in the virtualized environment. These changes help cloud providers to detect resource freeing attack in the cloud.",,2016,10.1177/0165551516654354,"M. Analoui, Shakiba Nayebalsadr",2.3333330000000001,1
231,Vehicular-cloud simulation framework for predicting traffic flow data,"The traffic flow prediction has become an important process tailored with the exponential development of cities and the transportation systems. The main purpose of the prediction task is to improve the logistic services and reduce the cost of the road congestion. In this paper, we propose a vehicular-cloud simulation framework with a layer of traffic cloud services to predict accurate traffic flow data. Learning of supervised traffic flow data from several data sources is the core of these services.

157,Comparison of Various Cloud Simulation tools available in Cloud Computing,"2 Abstract: Cloud computing is sharing of computer hardware and software resources over the internet so that anyone who is connected to the internet can access it as a service in a seamless way. As we are moving more and more towards the application of this newly emerging technology, it is essential to study, evaluate and analyse the performance, security and other related problems that might be encountered in cloud computing. Since, it is not a feasible way to directly analyse the behaviour of cloud on such problems using the real hardware and software resources due to its high costs, modelling and simulation has become a very powerful tool to cope with these issues. In this paper, we review, analyse and compare features of the existing cloud computing modelling and simulation tools.",,2015,10.17148/ijarcce.2015.4342,"Mayank Shekhar, Utkal Sinha",2.1,1
63,Extending CloudSim to simulate sensor networks,"With the enormous growth of sensing devices tending to the use of Internet of everything, data aggregated by these devices are the biggest data streams generated in the history of IT. Thus, aggregating such data in the cloud for leveraging powerful cloud computing processing and storage is essential, and it eventually led to the emergence of Sensor-Cloud concept. This has allowed aggregation of the sensors’ data to the cloud for further processing, storage, and visualization. Furthermore, virtualization makes the sensors accessible to other end-user applications that require such data. All of these features are expected to be provided by the Sensor-Cloud invisibly, without the end-user application developer being aware of the sensor location or hardware specifications. For these reasons, a simulation platform where Sensor-Cloud infrastructure agents and components may be modeled, scheduling policies defined, and execution time assessed is essential to assure performance and quality of service. The aim of this study is to develop such a platform by enhancing CloudSim, the most well-known and powerful simulation tool for cloud computing. A user-friendly Java Script Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI) has been carefully designed and implemented for this purpose. The user can then utilize the specific interface to define the Cloudlet type as well as the scheduling on a single virtual machine. Finally, a simulation study is carried out on the platform to demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy. We were able to fully model the needed scenarios and acquire real-time results, displaying good accuracy in terms of application response time with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.37%, demonstrating the increased proposed platform’s proper operation.",International Conference on Advances in System Simulation,2022,10.1177/00375497221105530,"E.

40,Secure Cloud Simulation Using Hybrid Algorithm,"Date of publication (dd/mm/yyyy): 03/12/2020 Abstract – At present, data security and privacy has been regarded as one of the biggest concerns in cloud computing. Data stored remotely is vulnerable and susceptible to threats. Due to this, users do not trust their data over the cloud. Cloud consumers want an assurance that they can access their data wherever they want without anyone else’s manipulation. Moreover, authentication of users over the cloud is another important factor to consider. After conducting surveys and studying various research papers it is found that the major security concerns of cloud computing includes Data leakage, Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). The data security can be improvised by implementing various symmetric key algorithms so that data on the server is stored in such a manner that even if a person can access the data, they can't view the original data, as it needs to be decrypted. Including storage security, authorized access of users also helps in avoiding DDOS as only genuine users will have access to the cloud. A hybrid model, a mixture between elliptical curve cryptography and symmetric key algorithm in which ECC is used for user verification and to keep the private data secure while AES algorithm is used to allow the user to store and access their data securely in the cloud by encrypting the data on the client side and decrypting the data after downloading from the cloud. Since the private key is owned by the user of the data, none can decrypt the data, even if hackers get their hands on the data. Moreover, the user will securely authenticate themselves by using various input parameters at the time of login to the cloud server. The whole prototype of the proposed solution would benefit by enabling a proper access mechanism to avoid unauthorized access to the information system and secure storage to allow access of data.",,2020,10.1007/s12652-020-02082-z,"P.

However, it is very challenging to accurately evaluate the performance and cost of applications without actual deployment on the clouds. Existing cloud simulators are generally designed from the perspective of cloud service providers, thus they can be under-developed for answering questions for the perspective of cloud users. To solve this prediction and evaluation problem, we created a Public Cloud IaaS Simulator (PICS). PICS enables the cloud user to evaluate the cost and performance of public IaaS clouds along with such dimensions like VM and storage service, resource scaling, job scheduling, and diverse workload patterns. We extensively validated PICS by comparing its results with the data acquired from real public IaaS cloud using real cloud-applications. We show that PICS provides highly accurate simulation results (less than 5% of average errors) under a variety of use cases. Moreover, we evaluated PICS' sensitivity with imprecise simulation parameters. The results show that PICS still provides very reliable simulation results with imprecise simulation parameters and performance uncertainty.",IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing,2015,10.1109/cloud.2015.37,"M.

75,Bazaar-Extension: A CloudSim Extension for Simulating Negotiation Based Resource Allocations,"Negotiation processes taking place between two or more parties need to agree on a viable execution mechanism. Auctioning protocols have proven useful as electronic negotiation mechanisms in the past. Auctions are a way of determining the price of a resource in a dynamic way. Additionally, auctions have well defined rules such as winner and loser determination, time restrictions or minimum price increment. These restrictions are necessary to ensure fair and transparent resource allocation. However, these rules are limiting flexibility of consumers and providers. In this paper we introduce a novel negotiation based resource allocation mechanisms using the offer-counteroffer negotiation protocol paradigm. This allocation mechanism shows similarities to the supermarket approach as consumer and provider are able to communicate directly. Further, the price is determined in a dynamic way similar to auctioning. We developed a Bazaar-Extension for CloudSim which simulates negotiation processes with different strategies. In this paper we introduce and analyze a specific Genetic Algorithm based negotiation strategy. For the comparison of the efficiency of resource allocations a novel Bazaar-Score was used.",IEEE International Conference on Services Computing,2016,10.1109/scc.2016.62,"W. Mach, E.

12,Design and evaluation of elastic media resource allocation algorithms using CloudSim extensions,"With the maturity of Cloud computing comes research into converting a range of traditionally best effort programs into cloud-enabled services. One such service currently under investigation in the Elastic Media Distribution (EMD) project, is how to enable qualitative, reliable and scalable realtime media collaboration services using proven Cloud technology. While existing best-effort solutions provide plenty of features, they do not provide the quality guarantees and reliability required for critical services in globally distributed corporations. On the other hand, some pricey dedicated solutions do offer these low-delay, reliable cooperation services, but without the benefits that clouds can bring in terms of scalability. In this paper we describe results attained in the EMD project on novel resource provisioning algorithms for a mixture of end-to-end Audio/Video streams with file-based transfers, allowing for configurable tradeoffs between service response time and cost. We extended the CloudSim simulator with models allowing us to simulate collaborative interactive sessions (more specifically educational real-time collaboration), and evaluated the performance of our proposed provisioning heuristics. The results show that the proposed dynamic algorithm allows for automated cost-performance tradeoff by reducing average total Virtual Machine (VM) cost by a maximum of 58% compared to more naive approaches, while keeping average time for clients to join a meeting in line.",Conference on Network and Service Management,2015,10.1109/cnsm.2015.7367377,"R.

43,CloudSimHypervisor: Modeling and Simulating Network Slicing in Software-Defined Cloud Networks,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an innovative technology which provides a programmable network control which is decoupled from the physical infrastructure. Network Virtualization (NV) is the phenomenon where a given physical network infrastructure and its resources are abstracted to create multiple logical virtual network slices of the underlying substrate. NV enables independent virtual networks to co-exist on one or more shared physical network infrastructure. Edge computing makes use of the edge resources in close proximity to end-users to reduce service delay and the network traffic volume in the end-to-end networks. Similarly, network slicing which is a key enabling technology for 5G networks is designed to support different services from different platforms at different scales enables sharing of physical network infrastructure on many different virtual network layers. These innovative technologies and strategies have gained significant attention from both academia and industry as they have the potential to maximize network resource utilization and optimize end–to–end network service delivery in 5G solutions deployment. To enable continuous simulation and development of applicable 5G networking concepts using these technologies, there is a need for an accessible and easy-to-learn testbed which is able to efficiently measure the performance of physical and virtual network capacities, provisioning approaches and management of multiple architectural models using large-scale network slicing configurations in a repeatable and controllable manner. These tools and toolkits provide scalable, lightweight and controlled cloud simulation environments necessary to analyse network traffic flows, allocation capacities and policies and the behaviour of multiple heterogeneous networks at an extremely low cost as compared to the huge financial commitments involved in conducting similar experiments in a real-life event. Existing solutions do not support Network Slicing and end- to -end heterogenous network automation which are key enablers of 5G network implementation. Hence in this paper, the CloudSimHypervisor framework is developed in this based on CloudSimSDN-NFV. The complete architecture and features of the CloudSimHypervisor framework and some used cases are presented in this paper. We validate the CloudSimHypervisor framework with two use case experiments in the cloud computing environment: Joint compute and network resource utilization and network traffic prioritization. Results from these experiments display the efficiency of the CloudSimHypervisor in estimating and measuring processing speed, transmission speed, compute and network usage efficiency and energy consumption.",IEEE Access,2021,10.1109/access.2021.3079501,"Maozhen Li, H.

53,Renovation of EdgeCloudSim: An Efficient Discrete-Event Approach,"Due to the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, edge computing concept has been widely studied to relieve the load on the original cloud and networks while improving the service quality for end-users. To simulate such a complex environment involving edge and cloud computing, EdgeCloudSim has been widely adopted. However, it suffers from certain efficiency and scalability issues due to the ignorance of the deficiency in the originally adopted data structures and maintenance strategies. Specifically, it generates all events at beginning of the simulation and stores unnecessary historical information, both result in unnecessarily high complexity for search operations. In this work, by fixing the mismatches on the concept of discrete-event simulation, we propose enhancement of EdgeCloudSim which improves not only the runtime efficiency of simulation, but also the flexibility and scalability. Through extensive experiments with statistical methods, we show that the enhancement does not affect the expressiveness of simulations while obtaining 2 orders of magnitude speedup, especially when the device count is large.",International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing,2021,10.1109/fmec54266.2021.9732572,"Raphael Freymann, Junjie Shi, Kuan-Hsun Chen, Jian-Jia Chen",1.0,1

Cloud computing aims to power the next generation data centers and enables application service providers to lease data center capabilities for deploying applications depending on user QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. To simplify this process, in this paper we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modelling and simulation of Cloud computing environments.

As low power CPUs, exemplified by ARM-based devices, are becoming increasingly popular, there is a growing trend for the large scale deployment of low power servers in data centres. For example, recent research has shown promising results on constructing small scale data centres using Raspberry Pi (RPi) single-board computers as their building blocks. To enable larger scale experimentation and feasibility studies, cloud simulators could be utilised. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators often need significant modification to include such low power devices as core data centre components. In this paper, we introduce models and extensions to estimate the behaviour of these new components in the DISSECT-CF cloud computing simulator. We show that how a RPi based cloud could be simulated with the use of the new models. We evaluate the precision and behaviour of the implemented models using a Hadoop-based application scenario executed both in real life and simulated clouds.","International Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing",2017,10.1109/pdp.2017.33,"Gábor Kecskeméti, Wajdi Hajji, Fung Po Tso",0.875,1

While a standard compact transient model exists for IT-equipment thermal mass and transient building-envelope models are well known, there are no existing true “black-box” modeling techniques for data center cooling systems. We propose such a compact model which can be incorporated into simple flow-network and detailed CFD models alike. The model idealizes the cooling system as a heat exchanger in series with additional mass. For most data center applications, a “quasi-steady-state” model is sufficient for the heat exchanger portion, however, we also propose a numerical (discretized) approach which may be employed for the complete range of data center (and other) applications.

179,Generic input template for cloud simulators: A case study of CloudSim,"Cloud computing and its service models, such as Platform as a Service (PaaS), have changed the way that computing resources are allocated to Information and Communications Technology enterprises and users. Although multiple cloud providers support dynamic service provisioning, it is necessary to facilitate the management of the cloud infrastructure and applications in order to allow the continuous refinement of cloud models. Therefore, issues are raised regarding the cloud orchestration, including the flexible portability and interoperability of cloud applications among multiple cloud providers. Having said that, there is a need for a standardized design and management of the cloud use cases (during the creation of scenarios, application's deployment, and patching) to ensure efficient applications' migration between different providers. This paper proposes an artifact, GITS, a generic input template for CloudSim and other cloud simulators. GITS can be provided by PaaS offering to manage the creation, monitoring, administration, and patching of infrastructure and applications in the cloud. GITS defines the cloud schema that can be used with conforming cloud models and independent cloud providers, thus, portability and interoperability can be enabled in PaaS cloud models. GITS focuses on the architecture‐based modeling for cloud infrastructure and application not only in terms of computational resources but also in terms of high availability properties associated with infrastructure and applications. The main objective of the GITS template is to provide the cloud user with a modular, simple, readable, and reusable model that still supports the essential components and provide them with the ability to control the applications' execution, deployment, and other management needs in addition to the allocation environment. This paper describes GITS usage, specifically as an input template for CloudSim.","Software, Practice & Experience",2018,10.1002/spe.2674,"A. Shami, Manar Jammal, Hassan Hawilo, A.

207,Cloud Simulation for Large-Scale Agent-Based Traffic Simulations,"It has always been the goal of urban system simulators to build ever-more detailed simulation models to understand the complex interactions between the different entities in the urban environment. In order to simulate these complex models, the computational power required is significant. The last two decades have shown that this problem of ever-more demanding software has been solved by increasing the processing power of a single CPU, increasing the number of processors of a CPU die and creating a better interconnect between the hardware nodes. The setup of such computing systems is an expensive endeavor and not accessible to everyone due to the complexity of setup and maintenance. Domain experts of smaller and medium-sized institutions are not able to conduct large-scale simulation experiments, since only large research centers like universities, large cooperations or the military can afford this kind of infrastructure. The growth of cloud computing in the last 10 years now allows computing environments to scale on demand. Since the infrastructure and services are comparable in performance to dedicated hardware, not only consumer-oriented web services can be improved, but also scientific simulation experiments can benefit greatly from this development. A high-performance simulation for urban systems is only one example. This thesis introduces a reference architecture for a cloud-based agent-based simulation platform, which allows domain experts of different fields to collaborate on simulation experiments. Apart from defining an abstract architecture, a specific implementation for traffic-simulation experiments has been developed as part of this thesis. This includes the extension of the SEMSim traffic (now CityMoS) simulation platform to be cloud capable as well as a data analysis framework for online data extraction of simulation data with a low bandwidth footprint. The scalability of cloud resources allows for a concurrent simulation-supported search-space exploration without much overhead. In this thesis an approach to improve the search-space exploration even further by using multi-resolution models to reduce the computational overhead when exploring a multi-dimensional search space is given.",,2019,10.1109/vppc46532.2019.8952361,D.
