GPUCloudSim: an extension of CloudSim for modeling and simulation of GPUs in cloud data centers,"Recent years have witnessed an increasing growth in the usage of GPUs in cloud data centers. It is known that conventional virtualization techniques are not directly applicable to GPUs, making it a challenge to effectively take advantage of virtualization benefits. API remoting, full, para and hardware-assisted virtualization methods are adopted to empower VMs with GPU capabilities. With such a diversity in approaches, there is a need for a simulation environment to study the effectiveness of GPU virtualization techniques and evaluate GPU provisioning and scheduling policies in cloud data centers. In order to model and simulate GPU-enabled VMs in cloud data centers, this work proposes and describes a simulator architecture implemented as an extension of CloudSim. The extension eases up conducting experimental studies that otherwise need to be carried out in real cloud infrastructures. It includes models to simulate interference among co-running applications, the overhead of virtualization and power consumption of GPUs. To demonstrate the usefulness of our extension, we study NVIDIA GRID, a hardware-assisted GPU virtualization solution. We show that for situations where the number of VMs outperforms the number of hosts, the first-fit VM placement of VMware Horizon may not be effective. Instead, we suggest a first-fit increasing VM placement algorithm which increases the acceptance rate by 59%, shortens makespan by 25% and saves energy by 21%.",,Selected,Abstract Screening,2.714286,3,,"M.

Study on fundamental usage of CloudSim simulator and algorithms of resource allocation in cloud computing,"Cloud computing is an internet-based pool of heterogeneous resources. The development of Cloud is scalable and reliable to make availability of resources when required to online users. Resources are provided as a service on demand with payment done on use basis. Nowadays, for less cost and maximize resource utilization, mainly computing is done on Cloud. Cloud simulator is a collection of java classes that provides simulation of concepts of cloud computing. Cloudlet scheduling is one of the most important task in cloud computing.

Optimization of performance and scheduling of HPC applications in cloud using cloudsim and scheduling approach,"Cloud computing is emerging as a promising alternative to supercomputers for some High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications. Cloud computing is an essential component of the back bone of the Internet of Things (IoT). Clouds are needed to support huge numbers of interactions with varying quality requirements. Hence, Service quality will be a vital differentiator among cloud providers. In order to differentiate themselves from their competitors, cloud providers should offer best services that meet customers' expectations. A quality model can be used to represent, measure and compare the quality of the providers, such that a mutual understanding can be established among clouds take holders. With cloud as an additional deployment option, HPC users and providers faces the challenges of dealing with highly heterogeneous resources, where the variability spans across a wide range of processor configurations, interconnects, virtualization environments, and pricing models. HPC applications are increasingly being used in academia and laboratories for scientific research and in industries for business and analytics. Cloud computing offers the benefits of virtualization, elasticity of resources and elimination of cluster setup cost and time to HPC applications users. Effort was taken for holistic viewpoint to answer the questions — why and who should choose cloud for HPC, for what applications and how the cloud can be used for HPC? Comprehensive performance and cost evaluation and analysis of running a set of HPC applications on a range of platforms, varying from supercomputers to clouds was carried out. Further, performance of HPC applications is improved in cloud by optimizing HPC applications' characteristics for cloud and cloud virtualization mechanisms for HPC. In this paper, a novel heuristics for online application-aware job scheduling in multi-platform environments is presented. Experimental results and Simulations using CloudSim show that current clouds cannot substitute supercomputers but can effectively complement them.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.625,3,,"D. B.

A cloud simulation based environment for multi-disciplinary collaborative simulation and optimization,"Multi-disciplinary virtual prototype (MDVP) based on modeling and computer simulation technology has been applied in a wide range of engineering applications, especially the design, testing and evaluation of complex products. Generally, a large set of parameters need to be optimized to improve the performance of the prototype, which comprises a number of heterogeneous models from multiple domains. This calls for numerous collaborative simulation experiments in heterogeneous computing environments, which are difficult to build and configure. Cloud simulation is a promising solution with the extremely large resource pool and dynamic construction of virtual computing environments. Thus this paper firstly proposed an optimization framework of MDVP which formulated the domain models, optimizer and the distributed interactive environment on cloud for multi-disciplinary engineers. Then we designed the procedure for conducting parallel optimization of MDVP in the cloud simulation system by con-current execution of MDVP simulation system. The method proposed in the paper has been applied to a MDVP in the aerospace industry, which indicates that the proposed method can support an efficient engineering methodology that can transform the traditional centralized, serial simulation optimization to the distributed collaborative and parallel simulation optimization.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,0.375,3,,"Mei Wang, Tingyu Lin, Lichao Wei, Chao Ruan, Liqin Guo, C.

Adaptive cloud simulation using position based fluids,"In this paper, we propose a method for the simulation of clouds using particles exclusively. The method is based on position based fluids, which simulates fluids using position constraints. To reduce the simulation time, we have used adaptive splitting and merging to concentrate computation on regions where it is most needed. When clouds are formed, particles are split so as to add more details to the generated cloud surface and when they disappear, particles are merged back. We implement our adaptive method on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to accelerate the computation. While the splitting portion is easily parallelizable, the merge portion is not. We develop a simple algorithm to address this problem and achieve reasonable simulation times. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,1.2,2,,"Y.

EdgeCloudSim: An environment for performance evaluation of Edge Computing systems,"Edge Computing is a fast growing field of research covering a spectrum of technologies such as Cloudlets, Fog Computing and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). Edge Computing involves technically more sophisticated setup when compared with the pure Cloud Computing and pure Mobile Computing cases since both computational and network resources should be considered simultaneously. In that respect, it provides a larger design space with many parameters rendering a variety of novel approaches feasible. Given the complexity, Edge Computing designs deserve scientific scrutiny for sound assessment of their feasibility. However, despite increasing research activity, this field lacks a simulation tool compatible with the requirements. Starting from available simulators a significant programming effort is required to obtain a simulation tool meeting the actual needs. To decrease the barriers, a new simulator tool called EdgeCloudSim streamlined for Edge Computing scenarios is proposed in this work. EdgeCloudSim builds upon CloudSim to address the specific demands of Edge Computing research and support necessary functionality in terms of computation and networking abilities. To demonstrate the capabilities of EdgeCloudSim an experiment setup based on different edge architectures is simulated and the effect of the computational and networking system parameters on the results are depicted.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,16.5,1,,"Cem Ersoy, Cagatay Sonmez, Atay Ozgovde",,2017,10.1109/fmec.2017.7946405,International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing,,,18
"CloudSim Plus: A cloud computing simulation framework pursuing software engineering principles for improved modularity, extensibility and correctness","Cloud computing is an established technology to provide computing resources on demand that currently faces several challenges. Main challenges include management of shared resources, energy consumption, load balancing, resource provisioning and allocation, and fulfilment of service level agreements (SLAs).

Usage of Cloud Computing Simulators and Future Systems For Computational Research,"Cloud Computing is an Internet based computing, whereby shared resources, software and information, are provided to computers and devices on demand, like the electricity grid. Currently, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) are used as a business model for Cloud Computing. Nowadays, the adoption and deployment of Cloud Computing is increasing in various domains, forcing researchers to conduct research in the area of Cloud Computing globally. Setting up the research environment is critical for the researchers in the developing countries to evaluate the research outputs. Currently, modeling, simulation technology and access of resources from various university data centers has become a useful and powerful tool in cloud computing research. Several cloud simulators have been specifically developed by various universities to carry out Cloud Computing research, including CloudSim, SPECI, Green Cloud and Future Systems (the Indiana University machines India, Bravo, Delta, Echo and Foxtrot) supports leading edge data science research and a broad range of computing-enabled education as well as integration of ideas from cloud and HPC systems.

Investigating Effects of Animated 3D Point Cloud Simulations on Emotional Responses,"3D simulations are increasingly used in virtual reality laboratory experiments for measuring emotional responses in order to gain a deeper understanding of the perception and judgment of visual landscape quality. Ensuring that these simulations are valid for the intended task is crucial. We demonstrate how we tested animations of a flight into 3D point cloud models of urban areas on the subject of their possible influence on people’s arousal response. Furthermore, we provide insights into the technical development and implementation of these simulations. The simulations were set up in a game engine and presented on a head-mounted display. In the experiment, one group first saw the areas in a bird’s-eye view followed by a flight down to a pedestrian view. The other group was shown the pedestrian view only. During the presentation, arousal was assessed by measuring skin conductance response and with the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) questionnaire. Based on the results we can conclude that the animated flight and the perceived movement that comes with it does not affect the measured arousal response signals. However, further studies are needed to understand the response patterns to the different urban areas. Regarding the animated landscape simulation, the level of detail management of 3D point clouds needs further enhancement in order to provide more consistent transitions between the abstract landscape representation during the flight and the highly detailed perspective at ground level. Alternative approaches such as a combination of 360° videos for the flight and 3D point cloud simulations should be tested.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,8.6,1,,"A.

Cloud Simulations for RoboCup,"Possibly the most appealing aspect of RoboCup is working with real robots, specially for young people. Yet as the complexity of the task increases, the effort in software development becomes higher, and a simulation testbed can be a valuable tool for prototyping and testing software solutions prior to their implementation on a real robot. In fact, several RoboCup leagues feature both real and virtual competitions. In addition, the RoboCup community could benefit from the cooperation and sharing of experiences among users in an online worldwide platform. We present a simulation tool based on the cloud, which can model complex robots off the shelf by using only a web browser as the base system for learning robotics, and running competitions. Such a platform minimizes costs and the troubles associated with different operating systems, while providing a rich experience of testing, with the possibility of a straightforward transfer to a real robot. Moreover, users can easily share their simulations for cooperative learning.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,8.125,1,,"E. Cervera, R. Téllez, Gustavo A.

CloudSimSDN: Modeling and Simulation of Software-Defined Cloud Data Centers,"Software-Defined Networking not only addresses the shortcoming of traditional network technologies in dealing with frequent and immediate changes in cloud data centers but also made network resource management open and innovation-friendly. To further accelerate the innovation pace, accessible and easy-to-learn testbeds are required which estimate and measure the performance of network and host capacity provisioning approaches simultaneously within a data center. This is a challenging task and is often costly if accomplished in a physical environment. Thus, a lightweight and scalable simulation environment is necessary to evaluate the network allocation capacity policies while avoiding such a complicated and expensive facility. This paper introduces CloudSimSDN, a simulation framework for SDN-enabled cloud environments based on CloudSim. This paper develops and presents the overall architecture and features of the framework and provides several use cases. Moreover, we empirically validate the accuracy and effectiveness of CloudSimSDN through a number of simulations of a cloud-based three-tier web application.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,7.6,1,,"R.

Octree‐based point cloud simulation to assess the readiness of highway infrastructure for autonomous vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are anticipated to supersede human drivers with an expectation of improved safety and operation. Since current infrastructure is designed based on the constraints caused by human drivers, it must be reassessed for autonomous driving compatibility. Recently, representatives from the infrastructure owners/operators (IOOs), automotive industry, and academia have advocated for new approaches to prepare roadways for the deployment of AVs over the next decade. Following these recommendations, this paper proposes a novel, simulation‐based approach for the assessment of highways ""readiness"" for AVs using 3D point cloud data. The proposed method uses octrees to perform volumetric queries for potential obstructions within an AV sensory field. The proposed approach is compared to a state‐of‐the‐art raycasting approach. Consequently, available sight distances and maximum safe speed limits based on road and AV characteristics are proposed. Finally, a discussion of the potential mitigation measures at the locations with limited sight distances is presented.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,6.75,1,,"Jonas Weiß, Maged Gouda, Jehanzeb Mirza, K.

Data-driven cloud simulation architecture for automated flexible production lines: application in real smart factories,"In recent years, more manufacturing enterprises are building automated flexible production lines (AFPLs) to satisfy the dynamic and diversified demand. Currently, static planning methods can hardly meet the requirements of the dynamic resource allocation for AFPLs. The technologies of the digital twin can help solve dynamic problems. Therefore, we propose a data-driven cloud simulation architecture for AFPLs in smart factories. First, we design a cloud simulation platform as the architecture foundation. Second, we use the data-driven modelling and simulation method to achieve automated modelling. Third, we implement the system on the cloud using Java, MySQL, and the Anylogic platform, and verify the efficiency of the proposed method by experiments in the real workshop of a 3C (Computer, Communication, Consumer electronics) company. The experimental results show the proposed architecture can support the real-time resource allocation decisions to maximise the throughput in AFPLs. This paper makes contributions by proposing an architecture realising automatic modelling and data-driven simulation first in the cloud simulation environment, and filling the gap of dynamic resource allocation in the research of AFPLs.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,5.5,1,,"C.

Construction of a Virtual Mobile Edge Computing Testbed Environment Using the EdgeCloudSim,"Mobile edge computing is a technology that can prepare for a new era of cloud computing and compensate for shortcomings by processing data near the edge of the network where data is generated rather than centralized data processing. It is possible to realize a low-latency/high-speed computing service by locating computing power to the edge and analyzing data, rather than in a data center far from computing and processing data. In this article, we develop a virtual mobile edge computing testbed environment where the cloud and edge nodes divide computing tasks from mobile terminals using the EdgeCloudSim simulator. Performance of offloading techniques for distribution of computing tasks from mobile terminals between the central cloud and mobile edge computing nodes is evaluated and analyzed under the virtual mobile edge computing environment. By providing a virtual mobile edge computing environment and offloading capabilities, we intend to provide prior knowledge to industry engineers for building mobile edge computing nodes that collaborate with the cloud.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,5.4,1,,Huhnkuk Lim,,2020,10.3390/electronics9040686,,,,247
Big Data meet green challenges : VM Consolidation impact on QoS and sustainability in CloudSim,"The number of connected devices is increasing day by day and is projected to reach approximately 50 billion by 2020. This leads to data generation on a whole new scale and such complex, vast and varied data is called Big Data. Big Data processing will lead the way into the future of smart and sustainable communities. Data Centers are needed as entities to deal with Big Data, but a major challenge is the immense energy consumption and danger towards sustainability. To counter these challenges, Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation is a technique for reducing energy and resource consumption of a cloud computing infrastructure. Several of these techniques have been studied with promising results but no solid work is present which analyzes their effects on a big data workload. This work aims to analyze the impact of VM consolidation in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality in Sustainability (QiS) by comparing a number of techniques in response to big data workload. This is done by simulating a cloud computing environment using CloudSim. The effect of VM consolidation along with Big Data characteristics is observed and results are presented based on which a combination of the algorithms is recommended.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,5,1,,Ijlal Ahmed Niazi,,2019,10.1145/3368691.3368717,,,,212
CloudSimSDN‐NFV: Modeling and simulation of network function virtualization and service function chaining in edge computing environments,"Software‐defined networking (SDN) has evolved and brought an innovative paradigm shift in computer networks by utilizing a programmable software controller with open protocols. Network functions, previously served on dedicated hardware, have shifted to network function virtualization (NFV) that enabled functions to be virtualized and provisioned dynamically upon generic hardware. In addition to NFV, edge computing utilizes the edge resources close to end‐users, which can reduce the end‐to‐end service delay and the network traffic volume. Although these innovative technologies gained significant attention from both academia and industry, there are limited tools and simulation frameworks for the effectiveness evaluation in a repeatable and controllable manner. Furthermore, large‐scale experimental infrastructures are expensive to setup and difficult to maintain. Even if they are created, they are not available or accessible for the majority of researchers throughout the world. In this paper, we propose a framework for simulating NFV functionalities in both edge and cloud computing environments. In addition to the basic network functionalities supported by SDN in CloudSimSDN, we added new NFV features, such as virtualized network functions allocation, migration, and autoscaling with the support of corresponding network functionalities, such as flow load balancing, rerouting, and service function chaining (SFC) maintenance. We evaluated our simulation framework with autoscaling and placement policies for SFC in the integrated edge and cloud computing environments. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in measuring and evaluating the end‐to‐end delay, response time, resource utilization, network traffic, and power consumption with different algorithms in each scenario.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,5,1,,"Jungmin Son, Tianzhang He, R.

A Review of Cloud Computing Simulation Platforms and Related Environments,"Recent years have seen an increasing trend towards the development of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) platforms to support cloud computing related decision making and research. The complexity of cloud environments is increasing with scale and heterogeneity posing a challenge for the efficient management of cloud applications and data centre resources. The increasing ubiquity of social media, mobile and cloud computing combined with the Internet of Things and emerging paradigms such as Edge and Fog Computing is exacerbating this complexity. Given the scale, complexity and commercial sensitivity of hyperscale computing environments, the opportunity for experimentation is limited and requires substantial investment of resources both in terms of time and effort. DES provides a low risk technique for providing decision support for complex hyperscale computing scenarios. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the development and extension of tools to support DES for cloud computing resulting in a wide range of tools which vary in terms of their utility and features. Through a review and analysis of available literature, this paper provides an overview and multi-level feature analysis of 33 DES tools for cloud computing environments. This review updates and extends existing reviews to include not only autonomous simulation platforms, but also on plugins and extensions for specific cloud computing use cases. This review identifies the emergence of CloudSim as a de facto base platform for simulation research and shows a lack of tool support for distributed execution (parallel execution on distributed memory systems).",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,4.75,1,,"P.

Exploiting CloudSim in a multiformalism modeling approach for cloud based systems,"Cloud based architectures present many challenges, ranging from poorly dimensioned hardware to lengthy wait times and resource balancing issues. Most of these problems can be mitigated by using proper performance evaluation techniques, depending on the accuracy of the model abstracting the real system.

In this sense, multiformalism proves itself to be a powerful modeling approach describing each system component according to the most suitable representation.

A CloudSim-Extension for Simulating Distributed Functions-as-a-Service,"The performance of Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) would be significantly improved by organizing cloud servers into a hierarchical distributed architecture, resulting in low-latency access and faster response when compared to centralized cloud. However, the distributed organization introduces a new type of decision making problem for placing and executing functions to a specific cloud server. In order to handle the problem, we extended a well-known cloud computing simulator, CloudSim. The extended CloudSim enables users to define FaaS functions with various characteristics and service level objectives (SLOs), place them across geo-distributed cloud servers, and evaluate per-function performance.

An Introduction of CloudSim Simulation tool for Modelling and Scheduling,"Cloud computing goals are to deliver secure, maintainable, fault-tolerant and reliable infrastructure for application services based on the net. To schedule and modeling the different services and applications on the cloud is a challenging job with different energy and load performances. The research on Cloud computing is still at the early stage and in order to resolve this problem CloudSim is introduced. CloudSim is a simulation tool, that has the ability to manage various services, scheduling the services and modeling infrastructure of the cloud.

Cluster-based Analysis of Multi-Parameter Distributions in Cloud Simulation Ensembles,"The proposed approach enables a comparative visual exploration of multi-parameter distributions in time-varying 3D ensemble simulations. To investigate whether dominant trends in such distributions occur, we consider the simulation elements in each dataset—per ensemble member and time step—as elements in the multi-dimensional parameter space, and use t-SNE to project these elements into 2D space. To find groups of elements with similar parameter values in each time step, the resulting projections are clustered via k-Means. Since elements with similar data values can be disconnected in one single projection, we compute an ensemble of projections using multiple t-SNE runs and use evidence accumulation to determine sets of elements that are stably clustered together. We build upon per-cluster multi-parameter distribution functions to quantify cluster similarity, and merge clusters in different ensemble members. By applying the proposed approach to a time-varying ensemble, the temporal development of clusters, and in particular their stability over time can be analyzed. We apply this approach to analyze a time-varying ensemble of 3D cloud simulations. The visualizations via t-SNE, parallel coordinate plots and scatter plot matrices show dependencies between the simulation results and the simulation parameters used to generate the ensemble, and they provide insight into the temporal ensemble variability regarding the major trends in the multi-parameter distributions.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,3,1,,"Josef Stumpfegger, Alexander Kumpf, R.

Investigation of Cloud Scheduling Algorithms for Resource Utilization Using CloudSim,"Compute Cloud comprises a distributed set of High-Performance Computing (HPC) machines to stipulate on-demand computing services to remote users over the internet. Clouds are capable enough to provide an optimal solution to address the ever-increasing computation and storage demands of large scientific HPC applications. To attain good computing performances, mapping of Cloud jobs to the compute resources is a very crucial process. Currently we can say that several efficient Cloud scheduling heuristics are available, however, selecting an appropriate scheduler for the given environment (i.e., jobs and machines heterogeneity) and scheduling objectives (such as minimized makespan, higher throughput, increased resource utilization, load balanced mapping, etc.) is still a difficult task. In this paper, we consider ten important scheduling heuristics (i.e., opportunistic load balancing algorithm, proactive simulation-based scheduling and load balancing, proactive simulation-based scheduling and enhanced load balancing, minimum completion time, Min-Min, load balance improved Min-Min, Max-Min, resource-aware scheduling algorithm, task-aware scheduling algorithm, and Sufferage) to perform an extensive empirical study to insight the scheduling mechanisms and the attainment of the major scheduling objectives. This study assumes that the Cloud job pool consists of a collection of independent and compute-intensive tasks that are statically scheduled to minimize the total execution time of a workload. The experiments are performed using two synthetic and one benchmark GoCJ workloads on a renowned Cloud simulator CloudSim. This empirical study presents a detailed analysis and insights into the circumstances requiring a load balanced scheduling mechanism to improve overall execution performance in terms of makespan, throughput, and resource utilization. The outcomes have revealed that the Sufferage and task-aware scheduling algorithm produce minimum makespan for the Cloud jobs. However, these two scheduling heuristics are not efficient enough to exploit the full computing capabilities of Cloud virtual machines.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,3,1,,"Muhammad Aleem, A.

IoTSim-Stream: Modelling stream graph application in cloud simulation,"In the era of https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/big-data, the high velocity of data imposes the demand for processing such data in real-time to gain real-time insights. Various real-time big data platforms/services (i.e. Apache Storm, Amazon Kinesis) allow to develop real-time https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/big-data-application to process https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/continuous-data to get incremental results. Composing those applications to form a workflow that is designed to accomplish certain goal is the becoming more important nowadays. However, given the current need of composing those applications into data pipelines forming stream https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/workflow-application (aka stream graph applications) to support decision making, a simulation toolkit is required to simulate the behaviour of this graph application in https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/cloud-computing.

Modelling resource heterogeneities in cloud simulations and quantifying their accuracy,"Simulations are often used to evaluate the performance of various scheduling and migration techniques in the context of large computing systems such as clouds and datacenters. To ensure that simulations match the real platform as close as possible, plausible assumptions and accurate statistical models are used in designing simulations; and that could also offer accurate results. However, it is not always possible that similar numerical results would also be achievable in a real cloud test-bed. The reason is that a simulator only abstracts a model and, hence, a system; but does not always reflect the real world scenarios. Therefore, the solution of any research problem using numerical simulation (experimentation) is not just to find a result, but also to ensure the quality and accuracy of the estimated results. CloudSim is largely used in the cloud research community to evaluate the performance of various resource allocation and migration policies. However, resources such as CPU, memory and application heterogeneities are not modelled yet. Moreover, its accuracy is rarely addressed. In this paper, we: (i) describe an extension to CloudSim that offers support for resource (CPU) and application heterogeneities; and (ii) demonstrate several techniques that could be used to measure the accuracy of results obtained in simulations, particularly, in the extended CloudSim. Based on our evaluation, we suggest that the accuracy and precision of the extended version of the CloudSim simulator may be as high as  ∼ 98.63% for certain energy and performance efficient resource allocation and consolidation with migration policies in heterogeneous datacenters.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,2.666667,1,,"Lee Gillam, M.

Self Organizing Map Based Evaluation of Present Day GCM Cloud Simulations,"Global cloud clusters are derived by applying the self organizing map technique to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud top pressure - cloud optical thickness joint histograms. These cloud clusters are then used to classify CFMIP Observation Simulator Package output from the HadGEM3 (GA7) atmosphere-only climate model. Discrepancies in the GA7 representation of particular clusters can be established by examining the two sets of cluster's occurrence rate and radiative effect. The overall differences in the occurrence rates show major discrepancies in several of the clusters, resulting in a shift from five dominant clusters in MODIS (above 10 % occurrence rate) to two dominant clusters in the model. A comparison of the geographic distributions of occurrence rate shows that the differences are strongly regional and unique to each cluster. While comparisons of the global mean longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) show strong agreement, examination of the CRE of individual cloud types reveals larger errors which highlight the role of compensating errors in masking model deficiencies. CRE data for each of the clusters is further partitioned into regions. This establishes that the bias associated with a cluster is highly variable globally, with no clusters showing consistent biases across all regions. Therefore, regional level phenomena likely play an important role in the creation of these errors. These clusters were then tied to the Cloudsat data which allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of the structure of cloud associated with the clusters. When combined with Calipso data this also allowed us to investigate the role of phase in these model biases.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,2.571429,1,,A. Schuddeboom,,2018,10.1002/2017jd028196,,,,169
Scheduler hierarchies to aid peta-scale cloud simulations with DISSECT-CF,"IaaS cloud simulators are frequently used for evaluating new scheduling practices. Unfortunately, most of these simulators scarcely allow the evaluation of larger-scale cloud infrastructures (i.e., with physical machine counts over a few thousand). Thus, they are seldom applicable for evaluating infrastructures available in commercial cloud settings (e.g., users mostly do not wait for simulations to complete in such settings). DISSECT-CF was shown to be better scaling than several other simulators, but peta-scale infrastructures with often millions of CPU cores were out of scope for DISSECT-CF as well. This paper reveals a hierarchical scheduler extension of DISSECT-CF that not only allows its users to evaluate peta-scale infrastructure behaviour, but also opens possibilities for analysing new multi-cloud scheduling techniques. The paper then analyses the performance of the extended simulator through large-scale synthetic workloads and compares its performance to DISSECT-CF's past behaviour. Based on the analysis, the paper concludes with recommended simulation setups that will allow the evaluation of new schedulers for peta-scale clouds in a timely fashion (e.g., within minutes).",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,2.4,1,,Gábor Kecskeméti,,2015,10.1287/moor.2014.0694,,,,171
Simulating the Resource Freeing Attack: Using Cloudsim Simulator,"Virtualization is a technique to make the cloud computations secure. This technique can reduce the costs and increase the reliability of systems by means of sharing the physical resources between several VMs (Virtual Machines). However, virtualized environments are vulnerable to some security issues such as lack of performance isolation. These days, using the virtualization as a technique is growing slowly in large organizations. Despite these advantages, virtualizations have created several security challenges. So, the main concern of virtualization service providers and their customers is how to detect and encounter these security challenges. In this research, the resource freeing attack is selected among all available virtualization attacks because of its simplicity and its drastic effects. Resource freeing attack causes an unfair resource distribution among VMs. We use Cloudsim as a powerful cloud simulation toolkit to implement resource freeing attack. After simulating the attack, the CPU's efficiency, response time diagrams, and the obtained bandwidth are measured. The simulation results show the significant changes in VM behavior after occurring the attack in the virtualized environment. These changes help cloud providers to detect resource freeing attack in the cloud.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,2.333333,1,,"M. Analoui, Shakiba Nayebalsadr",,2016,10.1177/0165551516654354,,,,186

"Energy-driven cloud simulation: existing surveys, simulation supports, impacts and challenges","A large scale cloud data center is needed to provision various applications in different domains. As a result, power consumption is expected to increase due to huge operations and expansion of cloud data centers. Furthermore, it also intensifies environment concern. Various approaches and solutions for energy-driven cloud data center have been proposed to overcome this challenge. Testing and evaluating these solutions in large scale is costly and time consuming. Hence, simulation techniques become the preferred approach to tackle this concern.

Extending CloudSim to simulate sensor networks,"With the enormous growth of sensing devices tending to the use of Internet of everything, data aggregated by these devices are the biggest data streams generated in the history of IT. Thus, aggregating such data in the cloud for leveraging powerful cloud computing processing and storage is essential, and it eventually led to the emergence of Sensor-Cloud concept. This has allowed aggregation of the sensors’ data to the cloud for further processing, storage, and visualization. Furthermore, virtualization makes the sensors accessible to other end-user applications that require such data. All of these features are expected to be provided by the Sensor-Cloud invisibly, without the end-user application developer being aware of the sensor location or hardware specifications. For these reasons, a simulation platform where Sensor-Cloud infrastructure agents and components may be modeled, scheduling policies defined, and execution time assessed is essential to assure performance and quality of service. The aim of this study is to develop such a platform by enhancing CloudSim, the most well-known and powerful simulation tool for cloud computing. A user-friendly Java Script Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI) has been carefully designed and implemented for this purpose. The user can then utilize the specific interface to define the Cloudlet type as well as the scheduling on a single virtual machine. Finally, a simulation study is carried out on the platform to demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy. We were able to fully model the needed scenarios and acquire real-time results, displaying good accuracy in terms of application response time with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.37%, demonstrating the increased proposed platform’s proper operation.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,2,1,,"E.

Secure Cloud Simulation Using Hybrid Algorithm,"Date of publication (dd/mm/yyyy): 03/12/2020 Abstract – At present, data security and privacy has been regarded as one of the biggest concerns in cloud computing. Data stored remotely is vulnerable and susceptible to threats. Due to this, users do not trust their data over the cloud. Cloud consumers want an assurance that they can access their data wherever they want without anyone else’s manipulation. Moreover, authentication of users over the cloud is another important factor to consider. After conducting surveys and studying various research papers it is found that the major security concerns of cloud computing includes Data leakage, Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). The data security can be improvised by implementing various symmetric key algorithms so that data on the server is stored in such a manner that even if a person can access the data, they can't view the original data, as it needs to be decrypted. Including storage security, authorized access of users also helps in avoiding DDOS as only genuine users will have access to the cloud. A hybrid model, a mixture between elliptical curve cryptography and symmetric key algorithm in which ECC is used for user verification and to keep the private data secure while AES algorithm is used to allow the user to store and access their data securely in the cloud by encrypting the data on the client side and decrypting the data after downloading from the cloud. Since the private key is owned by the user of the data, none can decrypt the data, even if hackers get their hands on the data. Moreover, the user will securely authenticate themselves by using various input parameters at the time of login to the cloud server. The whole prototype of the proposed solution would benefit by enabling a proper access mechanism to avoid unauthorized access to the information system and secure storage to allow access of data.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,1.8,1,,"P.

Comparative Study of Task Scheduling Algorithms through Cloudsim,"Delivery of reliable services in cloud environment is a major issue. Reliability may be achieved by implementing the fault tolerance. Due to the abundant growth of traffic and service request on cloud datacenters, balancing the load in cloud environment is one of the serious challenges as failure may occur due to increase in power consumption, node failure, machine failure etc. Therefore there is a needof a policy for balancing the load among the datacenters and various solutions to balance the load have been proposed by researchers. Load distributionis the mechanism of dispersal the load between different nodes based on certain parameters such as underloaded(node) and overloaded (node). In this research articlewe have discussed the concept of dispersal of load and then perform a comparative analysis of various task-scheduling policies such as First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First and Round Robin onCloudsim.The simulation results on Cloudsim depicted that RR task-scheduling is much better than the FCFS and SJF whether we are using the Time shared policy or Space shared policy for execution of cloudlet.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,1.714286,1,,"T.

PICS: A Public IaaS Cloud Simulator,"Public clouds become essential for many organizations to run their applications because they provide huge financial benefits and great flexibility. However, it is very challenging to accurately evaluate the performance and cost of applications without actual deployment on the clouds. Existing cloud simulators are generally designed from the perspective of cloud service providers, thus they can be under-developed for answering questions for the perspective of cloud users. To solve this prediction and evaluation problem, we created a Public Cloud IaaS Simulator (PICS). PICS enables the cloud user to evaluate the cost and performance of public IaaS clouds along with such dimensions like VM and storage service, resource scaling, job scheduling, and diverse workload patterns. We extensively validated PICS by comparing its results with the data acquired from real public IaaS cloud using real cloud-applications. We show that PICS provides highly accurate simulation results (less than 5% of average errors) under a variety of use cases. Moreover, we evaluated PICS' sensitivity with imprecise simulation parameters.

ContainerCloudSim: An environment for modeling and simulation of containers in cloud data centers,"Containers are increasingly gaining popularity and becoming one of the major deployment models in cloud environments. To evaluate the performance of scheduling and allocation policies in containerized cloud data centers, there is a need for evaluation environments that support scalable and repeatable experiments.

Multimedia services are used to be delivered through Cloud computing with severe QoS necessities. So there is a recent research is going on as a challenge between researchers, the QoS-aware, cost-efficient selection of data centers, due to these all necessities. Here in this work, there is an optimization approach to observe Cloud Data Center Selection Problem. The main feature of cloud computing is to achieve a high user agreement and enlarged resource consumption ratio by ensuring an well-organized and fair allotment of every computing resource is efficient load balancing. It helps to get appropriate load balancing aids in minimizing resource utilization, implementing fail-over, enabling scalability, avoiding bottleneck etc. In cloud computing situation load balancing is self-possessed of selecting data center for future demand and virtual machine organization at entity data center. Cloud computing resources have a variety of technology that make easy the implementation of big scale requirement. Therefore, the selection of appropriate data center for execution of a task is a significant feature to improve the performance of cloud computing.

Edgenetworkcloudsim: Placement of service chains in edge clouds using networkcloudsim,"Edge cloud computing is a trending paradigm, which extends cloud computing by additionally utilizing computing resources at the network edge, e.g., at mobile base stations. Especially personalized services can be instantiated or migrated close to end users, which improves the latency and supports user mobility. However, the placement of the service chains is crucial for the performance of the services and the energy consumption of the edge cloud platform, and appropriate algorithms have to be designed. To support the simulative performance evaluation of such algorithms, EdgeNetworkCloudSim was developed.

Integrating I/Os in Cloudsim for Performance and Energy Estimation,"This article presents an extension of the IaaS Cloud simulator CloudSim. This extension takes into account the processing of i/o workload generated by virtual machines within a data center, and evaluates the overall performance and energy consumption. Indeed, according to state-of-the-art mstudies, storage systems energy consumption may account for as much as 40% in a data center. So, we modified the time computation model of CloudSim to consider i/o operations. Additionally, we designed several models of storage system devices including Hard Disk Drives and Solid-State Drives. We also modeled cpu utilization to compute the energy consumptions related to i/o request processing. This was achieved through machine learning techniques. Our storage system extensions have been evaluated using video encoding traces. The simulation results show that a significant amount of energy, around 25%, is consumed due to i/o workload execution.

Energy-Efficient And Improved Qos -Driven Task Scheduling Algorithm In Mcc Environment Using Cloudsim Simulator,"Feature selection plays an important role in breast cancer classification. Feature selection identifies the most informative feature subset from feature set that can accurately classify the given data.

CloudSimSFC: Simulating Service Function chains in Multi-Domain Service Networks,"Service Function Chain (SFC) is widely adopted in Multi-domain https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/network-service (MDSN) to enforce network policies on customer traffic. Great effort has been devoted to the research of SFC https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/deployment-strategy. In this context, simulators are helpful to the design and evaluation of those strategies. A good SFC simulator should be accurate, comprehensive and user-friendly for SFC simulation. However, existing simulators fail to satisfy the requirement due to two major drawbacks: First, they overlook the resource heterogeneity and performance instability of the MDSN environment. Second, their performance models for service functions are too simple to contain the important features such as traffic changing effect and packet queue. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose CloudSimSFC — a new SFC simulator that (1) simulates the performance fluctuations and server failure/recovery events in MDSN environment to align with the performance instability of real-world systems, (2) elaborates the modeling of service functions by incorporating the computation components such as CPU and queue, and the traffic changing effect which happens during https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/packet-processing, (3) employs scenario abstraction to simplify the definition of new (heterogeneous) simulation scenarios and supports standard service metrics like request–response time. With these features, CloudSimSFC can be used to simulate SFC run-time performance and evaluate deployment strategies. We introduce the https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/system-architectures of CloudSimSFC to explain the simulation principle. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the simulation accuracy of CloudSimSFC by comparing it with an SFC prototype. Experimental results confirm that CloudSimSFC achieves 95%+ accuracy in all the evaluation scenarios. We also evaluate the simulation running time and analyze the overhead caused by the proposed simulation features. Finally, we demonstrate the primary usage of CloudSimSFC with https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/case-study.

ACE: Availability-Aware CloudSim Extension,"In the interconnected globe where service delivery is the success measure, cloud high availability (HA) is an indispensable area for enterprises. An HA-aware cloud system provides different approaches to handle the outages. This includes geo-redundancy, failover schemes, and HA-aware placement solutions. However, using real-cloud platforms to model HA-aware approaches is hindered by the configuration settings. To this end, simulation tools, such as CloudSim, can be used to evaluate HA solutions and a cloud resiliency against failures. CloudSim allows implementing of scheduling policies, but it does not support HA properties. This paper provides availability-aware CloudSim extension (ACE). ACE extends CloudSim with a graphical and textual modeling to ensure simplicity and reusability of cloud scenarios. ACE has added HA-aware modeling (HA metrics and failure/redundancy/interdependency models) and HA-aware scheduling (HA-aware placements, failover, repair, and load balancing policies) into CloudSim. With ACE, the creation of cloud scenarios is facilitated, and multiple HA-aware deployment solutions can be evaluated under different stochastic and deterministic events. ACE can assess the impact of different redundancy/failure models, and other performance policies to extract HA-aware lessons.

IsV2C: An Integrated Road Traffic-Network-Cloud Simulator for V2C Connected Car Services,"The recent growth of connected car technology encourages IT and vehicle organizations to develop advanced vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) services such as driving assistance, infotainment, and vehicle maintenance. However, since their performances highly depend on the resource configuration and regional characteristics, it is almost impossible to examine the service feasibility in every candidate region by constructing real testbeds. To overcome this problem, we present an integrated road traffic-network-cloud simulator for V2C connected car services (IsV2C) with a user-friendly GUI. The IsV2C aims to evaluate V2C services with the user-specified V2C environment and service scenarios in a particular region. In the IsV2C, road traffic, network, and cloud simulation are intimately linked to reflect both the realistic movement of vehicles and service transactions in real-time. To accurately mimic task execution in both vehicles and the cloud, the IsV2C utilizes a rigorous emulation for evaluated services. Simulation results of the IsV2C show whether each simulated application satisfies the service level objectives regarding service time, cloud cost, and data transmission performance. As for the validation, we evaluated three sample V2C applications in an urban area, and the results proved that the IsV2C could offer useful information to both service providers and cloud providers for their service launching and profit estimation. To the best of our knowledge, the IsV2C is the first work that presents an integrated road traffic-network-cloud simulation framework for an end-to-end V2C service evaluation.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,1.25,1,,"Sungpil Woo, Nhat Pham, Minsu Jeon, Jisoo Choi, Jiyong Han, Jeongkyu Park, Dongsik Yoon, Seonghwan Kim, Daeyoung Kim, Chan-Hyun Youn, Eunjoo Yang, Heejae Kim",,2017,10.1109/scc.2017.62,IEEE International Conference on Services Computing,,,91
A modelling & Simulation via CloudSim for Live Migration in Virtual Machines,"In growing era of cloud computing, one major utility is better and improved performance. For which Cloud Computing is a model which provides various resources available in a pool from where the users can get available the same when required. In the overall process there can be an important issue that is Fault tolerance to provide the high availability for the process which is being required by the user. And simultaneously if any fault occurs then user might not found any server downtime and other kind of delay in getting the response. There are many compute nodes such as Virtual machines further controlled by the Hypervisor. For transferring the load among compute nodes can be done by Cold Migration earlier there was a technique Non-Live migration. But at the same time there were lot many issues and challenges with the same that user might get the server downtime for infinite delay.

PerficientCloudSim: a tool to simulate large-scale computation in heterogeneous clouds,"The major reason for using a simulator, instead of a real test-bed, is to enable repeatable evaluation of large-scale cloud systems. CloudSim, the most widely used simulator, enables users to implement resource provisioning, and management policies. However, CloudSim does not provide support for: (i) interactive online services; (ii) platform heterogeneities; (iii) virtual machine migration modelling; and (iv) other essential models to abstract a real datacenter. This paper describes modifications needed in the classical CloudSim to support realistic experimentations that closely match experimental outcomes in a real system. We extend, and partially re-factor CloudSim to “PerficientCloudSim” in order to provide support for large-scale computation over heterogeneous resources. In the classical CloudSim, we add several classes for workload performance variations due to: (a) CPU heterogeneities; (b) resource contention; and (c) service migration. Through plausible assumptions, our empirical evaluation, using real workload traces from Google and Microsoft Azure clusters, demonstrates that “PerficientCloudSim” can reasonably simulate large-scale heterogeneous datacenters in respect of resource allocation and migration policies, resource contention, and platform heterogeneities.

Scheduling in CloudSim of Interdependent Tasks for SLA Design,"One of the most recent concepts in the framework of today’s distributed systems is Cloud Computing. A very difficult problem that needs to be addressed is the management of the Cloud. When designing a Cloud scheduling strategy, the design trade-offs of the Cloud architecture should be evaluated.

This article examines three different algorithms that consider the scheduling of tasks in Cloud, which are described as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) (interdependent tasks). The results of the scheduling algorithms are valuable because they are helpful for the design of the Cloud Computing scheduling algorithms and for the design of a Service Level Agreement (SLA) contract whose members are the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and the Cloud Service Customers (CSCs).

Bazaar-Extension: A CloudSim Extension for Simulating Negotiation Based Resource Allocations,"Negotiation processes taking place between two or more parties need to agree on a viable execution mechanism. Auctioning protocols have proven useful as electronic negotiation mechanisms in the past. Auctions are a way of determining the price of a resource in a dynamic way. Additionally, auctions have well defined rules such as winner and loser determination, time restrictions or minimum price increment. These restrictions are necessary to ensure fair and transparent resource allocation. However, these rules are limiting flexibility of consumers and providers. In this paper we introduce a novel negotiation based resource allocation mechanisms using the offer-counteroffer negotiation protocol paradigm. This allocation mechanism shows similarities to the supermarket approach as consumer and provider are able to communicate directly. Further, the price is determined in a dynamic way similar to auctioning. We developed a Bazaar-Extension for CloudSim which simulates negotiation processes with different strategies.

Design and evaluation of elastic media resource allocation algorithms using CloudSim extensions,"With the maturity of Cloud computing comes research into converting a range of traditionally best effort programs into cloud-enabled services. One such service currently under investigation in the Elastic Media Distribution (EMD) project, is how to enable qualitative, reliable and scalable realtime media collaboration services using proven Cloud technology. While existing best-effort solutions provide plenty of features, they do not provide the quality guarantees and reliability required for critical services in globally distributed corporations. On the other hand, some pricey dedicated solutions do offer these low-delay, reliable cooperation services, but without the benefits that clouds can bring in terms of scalability. In this paper we describe results attained in the EMD project on novel resource provisioning algorithms for a mixture of end-to-end Audio/Video streams with file-based transfers, allowing for configurable tradeoffs between service response time and cost. We extended the CloudSim simulator with models allowing us to simulate collaborative interactive sessions (more specifically educational real-time collaboration), and evaluated the performance of our proposed provisioning heuristics.

Renovation of EdgeCloudSim: An Efficient Discrete-Event Approach,"Due to the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, edge computing concept has been widely studied to relieve the load on the original cloud and networks while improving the service quality for end-users. To simulate such a complex environment involving edge and cloud computing, EdgeCloudSim has been widely adopted.

CloudSimHypervisor: Modeling and Simulating Network Slicing in Software-Defined Cloud Networks,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an innovative technology which provides a programmable network control which is decoupled from the physical infrastructure. Network Virtualization (NV) is the phenomenon where a given physical network infrastructure and its resources are abstracted to create multiple logical virtual network slices of the underlying substrate. NV enables independent virtual networks to co-exist on one or more shared physical network infrastructure. Edge computing makes use of the edge resources in close proximity to end-users to reduce service delay and the network traffic volume in the end-to-end networks. Similarly, network slicing which is a key enabling technology for 5G networks is designed to support different services from different platforms at different scales enables sharing of physical network infrastructure on many different virtual network layers. These innovative technologies and strategies have gained significant attention from both academia and industry as they have the potential to maximize network resource utilization and optimize end–to–end network service delivery in 5G solutions deployment. To enable continuous simulation and development of applicable 5G networking concepts using these technologies, there is a need for an accessible and easy-to-learn testbed which is able to efficiently measure the performance of physical and virtual network capacities, provisioning approaches and management of multiple architectural models using large-scale network slicing configurations in a repeatable and controllable manner. These tools and toolkits provide scalable, lightweight and controlled cloud simulation environments necessary to analyse network traffic flows, allocation capacities and policies and the behaviour of multiple heterogeneous networks at an extremely low cost as compared to the huge financial commitments involved in conducting similar experiments in a real-life event. Existing solutions do not support Network Slicing and end- to -end heterogenous network automation which are key enablers of 5G network implementation. Hence in this paper, the CloudSimHypervisor framework is developed in this based on CloudSimSDN-NFV. The complete architecture and features of the CloudSimHypervisor framework and some used cases are presented in this paper. We validate the CloudSimHypervisor framework with two use case experiments in the cloud computing environment: Joint compute and network resource utilization and network traffic prioritization.

As low power CPUs, exemplified by ARM-based devices, are becoming increasingly popular, there is a growing trend for the large scale deployment of low power servers in data centres. For example, recent research has shown promising results on constructing small scale data centres using Raspberry Pi (RPi) single-board computers as their building blocks. To enable larger scale experimentation and feasibility studies, cloud simulators could be utilised. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators often need significant modification to include such low power devices as core data centre components. In this paper, we introduce models and extensions to estimate the behaviour of these new components in the DISSECT-CF cloud computing simulator. We show that how a RPi based cloud could be simulated with the use of the new models. We evaluate the precision and behaviour of the implemented models using a Hadoop-based application scenario executed both in real life and simulated clouds.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.875,1,,"Gábor Kecskeméti, Wajdi Hajji, Fung Po Tso",,2017,10.1109/pdp.2017.33,"International Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing",,,102
Does CloudSim Accurately Model Micro Datacenters?,"Novel cloud computing algorithms and techniques are initially evaluated via testbeds, simulators and mathematical models of datacenter infrastructure. However, it can be difficult to perform cross validation of these platforms against realistic scale infrastructures due to the prohibitive costs involved. This paper describes an approach to evaluating a cloud simulator through an empirical study involving a micro datacenter of commodity Raspberry Pi devices. To demonstrate the methodology, we compare performance of real-world workloads on this physical infrastructure against corresponding models of the workloads and infrastructure on the CloudSim simulator. After modelling a Raspberry Pi micro datacenter in CloudSim, we claim that the simulator lacks sufficient accuracy for cloud infrastructure experiments.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.875,1,,"Dhahi Alshammari, Jeremy Singer, Timothy Storer",,2017,10.1109/cloud.2017.97,IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing,,,10
Generic input template for cloud simulators: A case study of CloudSim,"Cloud computing and its service models, such as Platform as a Service (PaaS), have changed the way that computing resources are allocated to Information and Communications Technology enterprises and users. Although multiple cloud providers support dynamic service provisioning, it is necessary to facilitate the management of the cloud infrastructure and applications in order to allow the continuous refinement of cloud models. Therefore, issues are raised regarding the cloud orchestration, including the flexible portability and interoperability of cloud applications among multiple cloud providers. Having said that, there is a need for a standardized design and management of the cloud use cases (during the creation of scenarios, application's deployment, and patching) to ensure efficient applications' migration between different providers. This paper proposes an artifact, GITS, a generic input template for CloudSim and other cloud simulators. GITS can be provided by PaaS offering to manage the creation, monitoring, administration, and patching of infrastructure and applications in the cloud. GITS defines the cloud schema that can be used with conforming cloud models and independent cloud providers; thus, portability and interoperability can be enabled in PaaS cloud models. GITS focuses on the architecture‐based modeling for cloud infrastructure and application not only in terms of computational resources but also in terms of high availability properties associated with infrastructure and applications. The main objective of the GITS template is to provide the cloud user with a modular, simple, readable, and reusable model that still supports the essential components and provide them with the ability to control the applications' execution, deployment, and other management needs in addition to the allocation environment. This paper describes GITS usage, specifically as an input template for CloudSim.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,0.857143,1,,"A. Shami, Manar Jammal, Hassan Hawilo, A.

A Compact Cooling-System Model for Transient Data Center Simulations,"The ability to accurately model transient events is a key consideration in the design and operation of reliable and resilient data centers. While a standard compact transient model exists for IT-equipment thermal mass and transient building-envelope models are well known, there are no existing true “black-box” modeling techniques for data center cooling systems. We propose such a compact model which can be incorporated into simple flow-network and detailed CFD models alike. The model idealizes the cooling system as a heat exchanger in series with additional mass. For most data center applications, a “quasi-steady-state” model is sufficient for the heat exchanger portion; however, we also propose a numerical (discretized) approach which may be employed for the complete range of data center (and other) applications. Finally, we perform transient measurements on a small-scale heat exchanger in order to validate the model.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.857143,1,,"W. Tian, J. Vangilder, M.

Cloud Simulation for Large-Scale Agent-Based Traffic Simulations,"It has always been the goal of urban system simulators to build ever-more detailed simulation models to understand the complex interactions between the different entities in the urban environment. In order to simulate these complex models, the computational power required is significant. The last two decades have shown that this problem of ever-more demanding software has been solved by increasing the processing power of a single CPU, increasing the number of processors of a CPU die and creating a better interconnect between the hardware nodes. The setup of such computing systems is an expensive endeavor and not accessible to everyone due to the complexity of setup and maintenance. Domain experts of smaller and medium-sized institutions are not able to conduct large-scale simulation experiments, since only large research centers like universities, large cooperations or the military can afford this kind of infrastructure. The growth of cloud computing in the last 10 years now allows computing environments to scale on demand. Since the infrastructure and services are comparable in performance to dedicated hardware, not only consumer-oriented web services can be improved, but also scientific simulation experiments can benefit greatly from this development. A high-performance simulation for urban systems is only one example. This thesis introduces a reference architecture for a cloud-based agent-based simulation platform, which allows domain experts of different fields to collaborate on simulation experiments. Apart from defining an abstract architecture, a specific implementation for traffic-simulation experiments has been developed as part of this thesis. This includes the extension of the SEMSim traffic (now CityMoS) simulation platform to be cloud capable as well as a data analysis framework for online data extraction of simulation data with a low bandwidth footprint. The scalability of cloud resources allows for a concurrent simulation-supported search-space exploration without much overhead. In this thesis an approach to improve the search-space exploration even further by using multi-resolution models to reduce the computational overhead when exploring a multi-dimensional search space is given.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.833333,1,,D.

WEAVESIM: A SCALABLE AND REUSABLE CLOUD SIMULATION FRAMEWORK LEVERAGING ASPECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING,"Cloud computing service-oriented simulation frameworks are very important tools for modeling and simulating
the dynamic behavior of cloud-based software systems. However, the existing service-oriented simulation
frameworks lack the ability to measure and control the rapidly changing (adaptive) requirements that span over
many modules in cloud-based software systems, such as security, logging, monitoring, …etc. To address these
limitations, this paper presents an efficient framework for reducing the complexity of modeling and simulating the
custom and dynamic behavior of cloud-based applications, called WeaveSim. WeaveSim utilizes the aspectoriented programming (AOP) to encapsulate the complexity of developing the dynamic behavior of cloud-based
applications by adding another abstract layer called Context-Aware Aspect Layer (CAAL). CAAL reduces the
complexity of using CloudSim to simulate cloud-based software systems. Examples of cross-cutting concerns are
data encryption, logging and monitoring. Since implementing a cross-cutting concern on a cloud-based simulator,
such as CloudSim, requires modifications, from developers, to many core modules of that simulator. However,
using WeaveSim, implementing cross-cutting concerns would be an easy task for developers, since they only need
to reuse pre-defined joinpoints and pointcuts without modifying the underlying core modules of the simulator. We
evaluated WeaveSim on an academically-scaled system. The results of our experimental evaluations show the
benefit of WeaveSim in reducing the complexity of implementing cross-cutting concerns on cloud-based software
systems. Hence, the reusability, scalability and maintainability of the cloud-based software systems are increased.

Proposal for standard compact server model for transient data center simulations,"Accurate prediction of data center temperatures and
airflow following a transient event, such as the loss of cooling
or variation in server load, requires that all sources of thermal
mass in the data center be modeled with sufficient accuracy.
One of the most important and simultaneously difficult-tomodel types of thermal mass in the data center is that of the servers that populate the facility. Although compact models of servers for transient applications have recently been proposed and much experimental measurement of servers undertaken, no one model or technique for estimating required server properties has emerged as the de facto standard for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) users and vendors. This paper, a collaborative effort by industry and university researchers active in the subject field, reviews the progress in transient server modeling to date and recommends a single, standard compact server model to be adopted by the data center community. Techniques for determining the transient server properties thermal capacitance and thermal effectiveness from detailed
measurements as well as simple correlations with server mass
and size are discussed. Example server properties are provided based on measurements from two independent laboratories. Finally, the sensitivity of server exhaust temperature predictions to uncertainties in server properties is discussed.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.6,1,,"Zachary M. Pardey, D. Demetriou, H.

Single Sign-On in Cloud Federation using CloudSim,"Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication mechanism in which a Cloud Service Consumer (CSC) needs to be authenticated only once while accessing various services from multiple service providers, or when accessing multiple services from the same service provider. In the case of Cloud Federation, the consumers can get services from various Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who are members of the federation, and SSO can be used to verify the legitimate users without requiring them to get authenticated with each service provider separately. CloudSim is a popular tool used for simulating various cloud computing scenarios. As of now, the simulator lacks effective user authentication and authorization methods with it. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of SSO mechanism in the Cloud Federation scenario using the CloudSim toolkit. We have used the Fully Hashed Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (FHMQV) protocol for the key exchange and the Symmetric Key Encryption technique AES-128 for encrypting the identity tokens.

Analysis of Cloud Environment Using CloudSim,"Cloud computing is a thirst area of research since it provides very important services such as platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), mobile “backend” as a service (MBaaS), software as a service (SaaS) in the computing and communication environment. Improving the performance of these services is a major challenge being addressed by many researchers. In the recent past, the cloud environment is set up by the service providers and the service is provided to the user in on-demand basis. The quality of the services provided by cloud computing highly depends on the performance of the cloud computing setup or environment (cloud setup). Developing the real cloud environment and evaluating their performance is impractical as it requires huge investment.

Data Migration: Cloudsim Extension,"With the constantly growing volume of data in the context of cloud applications deployed in geographically distributed systems, the issue of data management has turned to be an essential study to evaluate the performance of the cloud system. Beside the classic task scheduling activity, handling input data for tasks becomes one of the most challenges towards intensive-data applications. In fact, input data should normally be gathered on the same datacenter where the task is scheduled for execution. So, to meet that, migration strategies are required for distant data and should be as efficient as possible. Data migration strategies consist on moving data across geographically distributed data centers in order to execute tasks in the cloud. Therefore, we need to know statistics about the entire mechanism, which has led us to extend Cloudsim, a popular simulation toolkit for large scale cloud computing infrastructures and application services. In this paper, we show how Cloudsim can be investigated to provide a scalable module able to simulate and perform data migration in cloud applications.

Dynamic virtual machine allocation policy in cloud computing complying with service level agreement using CloudSim,"Cloud computing provides services over the internet and provides application resources and data to the users based on their demand.

Actuator behaviour modelling in IoT-Fog-Cloud simulation,"The inevitable evolution of information technology has led to the creation of IoT-Fog-Cloud systems, which combine the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Fog Computing. IoT systems are composed of possibly up to billions of smart devices, sensors and actuators connected through the Internet, and these components continuously generate large amounts of data. Cloud and fog services assist the data processing and storage needs of IoT devices. The behaviour of these devices can change dynamically (e.g. properties of data generation or device states). We refer to systems allowing behavioural changes in physical position (i.e. geolocation), as the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT). The investigation and detailed analysis of such complex systems can be fostered by simulation solutions.

Scheduling Cloudlets to Improve Response Time Using CloudSim Simulator,"The sustainability of any system is based on the performance and the service it gives to the users. The main objective of this work is to assess the performance of the cloud system in terms of its response time using CloudSim simulator. The performance is evaluated on a set of heterogenous cloudlets and the way the processing cores of the host are provision to the cloudlets and virtual machines (VMs) in the execution engine. The default scheduling algorithm used by the CloudSim simulator to allocate these cloudlets from the datacenter broker to the VM is based on the first come first serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm. This paper proposed the shortest job first (SJF) algorithm to allocate the incoming cloudlets to VM in the ascending order of its length whose response time is evaluated when space-shared and time-shared provisioning policy is implemented. The experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm shows better improvement when the order of length is considered.

ICARO Cloud Simulator exploiting knowledge base,"Allocation changes on cloud are complex and time consuming tasks, on cloning, scaling, etc. A solution to cope with these aspects is to perform a simulation. Cloud simulators have been proposed to assess conditions adopting specific models for energy, cloud capacity, allocations, networking, security, etc. In this paper, ICARO Cloud Simulator is proposed. It has been specifically designed for simulating the workload on the basis of real virtual machine workloads and for simulating complex business configurations and behaviours for wide temporal windows. This approach can be useful to predict and simulate the allocation of virtual machines on hosts and, thus, https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/data-center on the basis of real business configuration behaviour for days, weeks, months, etc. (for example, to predict workloads).

mtCloudSim: A Flow-Level Network Simulator for Multi-Tenant Cloud,"Currently, novel topologies and advanced resource allocation strategies for multi-tenant cloud datacenters are two research hotspots. Due to the high convenience and efficiency, researchers tend to use simulation to evaluate the proposed topologies or strategies. However, the current network simulators do not support the multi-tenant cloud environment inherently. Moreover, the low simulation speed and high memory consumption limit the traditional packet-level simulators to estimate the scenario of large-scale datacenters. In this paper, we propose a new flow-level network simulator, mtCloudSim, to overcome the above issues. The simulator estimates the data flow's behavior in the real world, i.e., 1) increasing the sending rate when the network is not busy and 2) suspending when the congestion occurs. Bandwidth isolation is inherently provided and users are allowed to define bandwidth requirement for the experiments with our simulator. Object-oriented programming (OOP) makes it easy to evaluate novel network topologies. The tracing system is also able to generate abundant and detailed statistics for experiments. The experiments demonstrate that mtCloudSim is available for multi-tenant cloud evaluation.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.444444,1,,"Junjie Xie, Yuhui Deng",,2016,10.1109/icpads.2016.0052,International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems,,,82
Enhance Cloudlet Scheduling Policy (ECSP) using cloudsim toolkit with resubmission fault tolerance mechanism,"Several research works are still going on in the domain of cloud computing and many traditional methods are used to highlight the parameters involved in QoS (Quality of Services) of cloud. QoS is associated with several parameters used to guarantee a service level such as performance, availability, and reliability. In cloud computing, to ensure cloud services proficient in environment, one of the challenges is to provide efficient cloudlet scheduling policy. The cloudlet scheduling policy plays key role as a lead to improve overall system performance such as minimizing the turnaround time waiting time and context switching. This project emphasizes and evaluates the QoS parameter by performed result comparison with previous work – Improved Round Robin Cloudlet Scheduling Algorithm (IRRCSA) and Round Robin Algorithm (RRA). CloudSim Toolkit will be used to improved cloudlet scheduling algorithm as well as Qualtiy of Sevice (QoS) performance by providing better execution time and turnaround time.

CoolCloudSim: Integrating Cooling System Models in CloudSim,"This paper addresses the problem of Data Centers (DCs) energy efficiency from a thermal perspective by extending the CloudSim framework to allow simulation and testing of thermal aware resource allocation policies aiming to minimize the cooling system energy consumption. The proposed framework, CoolCloudSim, can be used to develop and test new thermal aware Virtual Machine (VM) allocation strategies aiming to optimize the energy consumption of both cooling system and IT resources while meeting Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The default CloudSim architecture is extended by adding classes which contain mathematical models of the thermal processes within the server room. Furthermore, four new VM allocation policies that consider the cooling system energy consumption are developed based on the thermal and cooling system models. Finally, experiments are run to evaluate various metrics on a set of default CloudSim allocation algorithms and the proposed allocation algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the default CloudSim allocation strategy, Power Aware Best-Fit Decreasing (PABFD), in terms of overall energy consumption and the number of VM migrations, and have on average better results than other existing allocation strategies.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.428571,1,,"Cristian Pintea, Claudia Pop, I.

Improving Cloud Simulation Using the Monte-Carlo Method,"In the cloud computing model, cloud providers invoice clients for resource consumption. Hence, tools helping the client to budget the cost of running his application are of pre-eminent importance. However, the opaque and multi-tenant nature of clouds make task runtimes variable and hard to predict, and hamper the creation of reliable simulation tools. In this paper, we propose an improved simulation framework that takes into account this variability using the Monte-Carlo method.

We consider the execution of batch jobs on an actual platform, scheduled using typical heuristics based on the user estimates of task runtimes. We model the observed variability through simple random variables to use as inputs to the Monte-Carlo simulation. Based on this stochastic process, predictions are expressed as interval-based makespan and cost. We show that, our method can capture over 90% of the empirical observations of makespan while keeping the capture interval size below 5% of the average makespan.

SecNetworkCloudSim: An Extensible Simulation Tool for Secure Distributed Mobile Applications,"Fueled by the wide interest for achieving rich-storage services with the lowest possible cost, cloud computing has emerged into a highly desired service paradigm extending well beyond Virtualization technology. The next generation of mobile cloud services is now manipulated more and more sensitive data on VM-based distributed applications. Therefore, the need to secure sensitive data over mobile cloud computing is more evident than ever. However, despite the widespread release of several cloud simulators, controlling user’s access and protecting data exchanges in distributed mobile applications over the cloud is considered a major challenge. This paper introduces a new NetworkCloudSim extension named SecNetworkCloudSim, a secure mobile simulation tool which is deliberately designed to ensure the preservation of confidential access to data hosted on mobile device and distributed cloud’s servers. Through high-level mobile users’ requests, users connect to an underlying proxy which is considered an important layer in this new simulator, where users perform secure authentication access to cloud services, allocate their tasks in secure VM-based policy, manage automatically the data confidentiality among VMs and derive high efficiency and coverage rates. Most importantly, due to the secure nature of proxy, user’s distributed tasks can be executed without alterations on different underlying proxy’s security policies.

HPC simulations of brownout: A noninteracting particles dynamic model,"Helicopters can experience brownout when flying close to a dusty surface. The uplifting of dust in the air can remarkably restrict the pilot’s visibility area. Consequently, a brownout can disorient the pilot and lead to the helicopter collision against the ground. Given its risks, brownout has become a high-priority problem for civil and military operations. Proper helicopter design is thus critical, as it has a strong influence over the shape and density of the cloud of dust that forms when brownout occurs. A way forward to improve aircraft design against brownout is the use of particle simulations. For simulations to be accurate and comparable to the real phenomenon, billions of particles are required. However, using a large number of particles, serial simulations can be slow and too computationally expensive to be performed. In this work, we investigate an message passing interface (MPI) + graphics processing unit (multi-GPU) approach to simulate brownout. In specific, we use a semi-implicit Euler method to consider the particle dynamics in a Lagrangian way, and we adopt a precomputed aerodynamic field. Here, we do not include particle–particle collisions in the model; this allows for independent trajectories and effective model parallelization. To support our methodology, we provide a speedup analysis of the parallelization concerning the serial and pure-MPI simulations. The results show (i) very high speedups of the MPI + multi-GPU implementation with respect to the serial and pure-MPI ones, (ii) excellent weak and strong scalability properties of the implemented time-integration algorithm, and (iii) the possibility to run realistic simulations of brownout with billions of particles at a relatively small computational cost. This work paves the way toward more realistic brownout simulations, and it highlights the potential of high-performance computing for aiding and advancing aircraft design for brownout mitigation.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.4,1,,"M.

Nutshell: Cloud Simulation and Current Trends,"Cloud computing has experienced enormous popularity and adoption in many areas, such as research, medical, web, and e-commerce. Providers, like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have deployed their cloud services for use. Cloud computing pay-as-you-go model, on demand scaling, and low maintenance cost has attracted many users. The widespread adoption of cloud paradigm upshots various challenges. The legacy data center and cloud architectures are unable to handle the escalating user demands. Therefore, new data center network architectures, policies, protocols and topologies are required. However, new solutions must be tested thoroughly, before deployment within a real production environment. As the experimentation and testing is infeasible in the production environment and real cloud setup, therefore, there is an indispensable need for simulation tools that provide ways to model and test applications, and estimate cost, performance, and energy consumption of services and application within cloud environment. Simulation tools providing cloud simulation environments currently are limited in terms of features and realistic cloud setups, focus on a particular problem domain, and require tool-specific modeling, which can be frustrating and time consuming. This paper aims to provide a detailed comparison of various cloud simulators, discuss various offered features, and highlight their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we also demonstrate our work on a new cloud simulator ""Nutshell"", which offers realistic cloud environments and protocols. The Nutshell is designed to diminish flaws and limitations of available cloud simulators, by offering: (a) multiple datacenter network architectures, like three-tier, fat-tree, and dcell, (b) fine grained network details, (c) realistic cloud traffic patterns, (d) congestion control strategies and analysis, (e) energy consumption, (f) cost estimation, and (g) data center monitoring and analysis.

Enhanced Framework for IoT Applications on Python Based Cloud Simulator (PCS),"As innovation develops, more human-made devices are able to communicate with each other by means of Internet.

The amount of information generated by IoT applications can overpower computer infrastructures which are not prepared for such a huge data hence they need more CPU cycles. Distributed computing offers a solution at infrastructure level that eases such problems by offering highly scalable computing platforms. This necessitates arranging the framework on demand to meet invariant changes which applications require, in a pay-per-use mode. Current methodologies empowering IoT applications are area specific or concentrate just on communication between devices, therefore they can not be effectively deployed to different domains. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a data centric framework for advancement of IoT applications executed in python based cloud simulator.

Scalability assurance process in replication and migration using cloud simulator,"In service-oriented computing, service customers call up services deployed by service providers and service providers are responsible to deal with the excellence of their services including scalability, accessibility and performance.

Power consumption analysis across heterogeneous data center using CloudSim,"Computing paradigm plays an important role to study the scientific applications. Here we focus on tool based simulation of Cloud computing Infrastructure for power aware analysis. We introduce the cloud computing paradigm for resource like data center which is enabled with DVFS (dynamic voltage frequency scaling) with power aware deployment across the Globe in different geographic region. In this paper we find out the best policy across data center with minimum power consumption. The management of resources, to schedule the task on cloud computing environment is difficult in real time mode across the Globe in different organizations with their own power consumption policies. If there is a case of non homogenous and data center without awareness about power consumption, hosts coming under this category consume maximum power which is not in favor of green computing. To deal with these limitations, we will use a discrete-event cloud simulation toolkit to identify that how to save power utilized at infrastructure level. It provides the processing view for creation of application level task, indexing of cloudlets on shared pool of storage, computing and network resources in their power aware and non power aware management process.

To solve the N-body problem in Lennard-Jones Potential, we minimized the interaction between particles by dividing the simulation space into many cells and we defined a cutoff distance to perform calculation between neighboring particles. Additionally, a separate distance is introduced between particles to maintain the stability in the Lennard-Jones system. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method is computationally inexpensive and suitable for real time applications where large-scale simulation of clouds is required.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.333333,1,,"Shuai Zhang, Bin Sheng, E.

Strategies for Integrating Deep Learning Surrogate Models with HPC Simulation Applications,"The emerging trend of the convergence of high performance computing (HPC), machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL), and big data analytics presents a host of challenges for large-scale computing campaigns that seek best practices to interleave traditional scientific simulation-based workloads with ML/DL models. A portfolio of systematic approaches to incorporate deep learning into modeling and simulation serves a vital need when we support AI for science at a computing facility. In this paper, we evaluate several strategies for deploying deep learning surrogate models in a representative physics application on supercomputers at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We discuss a set of recommended deployment architectures and implementation approaches. We analyze and evaluate these alternatives and show their performance and scalability up to 1000 GPUs on two mainstream platforms equipped with different deep learning hardware and software stacks.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,0.333333,1,,"M.

"A Study on the Fundamental Properties, Features and Usage of Cloud Simulators","Cloud computing is one of the key innovations in this era of technology. Fuelling us into a century of massively distributed cloud applications and services, cloud applications can be accessed with the greatest of ease simply via a web browser. As we advance further into this world of cloud computing, it is highly essential to develop methods to gauge the performance level of the cloud environment. Currently, modelling and simulation technology are the main methods in use to carry out the evaluations. Numerous cloud simulators like CloudSim, techcloud, Greencloud, cloudnet and simizer have specifically been designed for analyzing and examining the performance of the various cloud computing environments.

Therefore the use of simulation tools to support decision making in cloud computing environments to cope with this problem is an increasing trend. However the data required in order to model cloud computing environments with an appropriate degree of accuracy is typically large, very difficult to collect without some form of automation, often not available in a suitable format and a time consuming process if done manually.

Implementation of trust model on CloudSim based on service parametric model,"Cloud Computing has a lot of research emphasis in recent years and it offers a virtual agenda of resource allocation of. In such a purely dispersed environment, an entity has freedom to use pool of resources. Due to compassion and vivacity of data or facts, such objects wish to access their specific closed resources. The user/consumer assumes good quality of service from a reliable service provider. The service provider, on the other hand assumes the cloud resources to be safe and it permits them to be exploited by a reliable consumer. To accomplish this, it is essential to create trust between entities of cloud across the cloud. Trust facilitates users to select the best available service in a diverse cloud infrastructure. A trust model is introduced based on past authorizations and present competences of a cloud service provider. Trust value is calculated using three parameters i.e. capability, behavior and feedback. A trust model is proposed to implement this trust value in cloud environment. The research work determines that our proposed model achieves better results than the existing trust models.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.3,1,,"Samar Sharma, Mehul Mahrishi",,2015,10.1109/icrcicn.2015.7434263,2015 IEEE International Conference on Research in Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (ICRCICN),,,81
A SLA-based scheduling approach for multi-tenant cloud simulation,"Modern product development becomes increasingly collaborative and parallel, which raises the need for sharing simulation resources in a multi-tenant simulation environment. However, the service requests and scheduling policies of tenants differ since system resources are shared by tenants. In order to deal with this issue, the framework of monitoring, detecting and scheduling system performance is proposed. As SLA is produced as the contract for negotiations between tenants and the service provider, the WS-Agreement specification is applied and improved to represent the service contents and qualities. Based on the SLA template, a dynamic resource distributing mechanism is realized. The Satisfaction Index is introduced into the scheduling of distributed resources, in which the weighted formula is determined by priorities. A case study has been undertaken and preliminary results show that the proposed solution can effectively support the cloud simulation and efficiently meet tenants' personal requirements.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.3,1,,"Gongzhuang Peng, Heming Zhang, Jiaxin Zhao, Minghui Li, Baocun Hou",,2015,10.1109/cscwd.2015.7231026,International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design,,,78
Geometry-Sensitive Ensemble Mean Based on Wasserstein Barycenters: Proof-of-Concept on Cloud Simulations,"ABSTRACT An ensemble of forecasts generated by different model simulations provides rich information for meteorologists about impending weather such as precipitating clouds. One major form of forecasts presents cloud images created by multiple ensemble members. Common features identified from these images are often used as the consensus prediction of the entire ensemble, while the variation among the images indicates forecast uncertainty. However, the large number of images and the possibly tremendous extent of dissimilarity between them pose cognitive challenges for decision making. In this article, we develop novel methods for summarizing an ensemble of forecasts represented by cloud images and call them collectively the Geometry-Sensitive Ensemble Mean (GEM) toolkit. Conventional pixel-wise or feature-based averaging either loses interesting geometry information or focuses narrowly on some pre-chosen characteristics of the clouds to be forecasted. In GEM, we represent a cloud simulation by a Gaussian mixture model, which captures cloud shapes effectively without making special assumptions. Furthermore, using a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm, we compute the Wasserstein barycenter for a set of distributional entities, which can be considered as the consensus mean or centroid under the Wasserstein metric. Experimental results on two sets of ensemble simulated images are provided. Supplemental materials for the article are available online.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.285714,1,,"Jia Li, Fuqing Zhang",,2018,10.1080/10618600.2018.1448831,Journal of Computational And Graphical Statistics,,,188
The Design of Reliability Simulation of Cloud System in the Cloudsim,"With the expansion of scale and the increase of users, the reliability of the cloud system has got more and more attention in the industry and academia. Services may be interrupted by random resource failures (such as network failure, virtual machine (VM)failure)in a realistic scenario. Many researchers have studied the reliability of cloud systems. However, in a cloud system, few of them propose a general sustainable platform to evaluate the effect of reliability on other quality of service (QoS)factor, such as energy, performance, ea.tl. To solve this problem, we first introduce two typical reliability factors including VM failure and server failure. Secondly, we give the design and realization of reliability simulation of cloud system in CloudSim.

Energy-Aware Cloud Computing Simulators: A State of the Art Survey,"Cloud computing is an emerging technology that offers pay-per-use IT services around the world. The daily increase in Cloud infrastructures and modern IT demands (such as web applications, scientific, and business) results in large-scale data centers that lead to additional electricity consumption. The high energy consumption causes a high operating cost and involves a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions that are harmful to the atmosphere. Many academic, governmental, and industrial studies show that energy consumed by computers and different communication units in a data center plays a significant role in the increase of data center operating costs. It is difficult to calculate the performance, security problems, and energy consumption in a true Cloud computing infrastructure. Therefore, in recent years, several simulation tools have been introduced to help researchers for the analysis of a Cloud computing environment. Cloud simulators need to perform simulation tests to reduce the various complexities in Cloud computing environments. Some Cloud simulators have been specially created to test the performance of Cloud computing environments. This study presents the comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art energy aware Cloud simulators.

MobileCloudSim: A Context-aware Simulation Toolkit for Mobile Computational Offloading,"Computational offloading has become an important strategy to augment computational capabilities of resource constrained devices. While several techniques and frameworks have been proposed in the literature, currently quantifying the cost of offloading in the wild remains challenging. Indeed, the performance of computational offloading is affected by contextual factors ranging from network quality to energy consumption of the device and load of the offloading infrastructure. This makes it infeasible for a single device to capture all possible contexts and to make optimal offloading decisions. To improve the design of offloading mechanisms, we propose MobileCloudSim, a novel and innovative context-aware simulation toolkit that can be used to asses the impact of computational offloading in a large-scale variety of complex contexts. Unlike traditional simulators that generate synthetic data, MobileCloudSim relies on crowdsensing to create realistic offloading conditions that characterize different offloading contexts.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,0.285714,1,,"S.

The Performance Evaluation of Virtual Machine Placement Algorithm Based on WebCloudSim,"Effective virtual machine placement algorithms can improve network resource utilization in cloud data centers. In order to design a more effective VM placement algorithm, we usually rely on a large-scale experimental platform to evaluate and verify its performance. However, large-scale experiment may have a huge impact on data center network, which makes it very unlikely to happen. Therefore, researchers need an experiment platform that can support large-scale environment to meet the above requirements. In order to evaluate the performance of virtual machine deployment algorithm, this paper first designs and implements a cloud data center network experiment system, WebCloudSim, which can support the joint experimental verification of real environment and simulation environment. Then, based on WebCloudSim, the paper implements three classic algorithms for virtual machine deployment, and verifies and analyzes the results.

Flexible Representation of IoT Sensors for Cloud Simulators,"In Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, actuators and smart devices are connected to the Internet. Application providers combine this connectivity with novel scenarios involving cloud computing. Some require in depth analysis of the interaction between IoT devices and clouds. Research focuses on questions like how to govern such large cohort of devices (i.e., often over tens of thousands). Distributed systems simulators help in such analysis, but they are problematic to apply in this newly emerging domain. Most simulators are either too detailed (e.g., need extensive knowledge on networking), or not extensible enough to support the new scenarios. This paper introduces our attempt to show how a state of the art simulator could model generic IoT sensors. We show the fundamental properties of IoT entities represented in the simulator. Based on these properties, we present an XML based, declarative modelling language aiming at: (i) describing the behaviour of sensors and their relation to clouds, and (ii) allowing rapid prototyping of simulations.

An Implementation of the WS-Agreement Negotiation Standard in CloudSim,"The currently dominating market mechanism for selling IaaS resources is the so called supermarket approach: Consumer buy resources from providers without negotiation. The recent development of Amazon EC2 spot market shows that dynamic market mechanisms are becoming increasingly popular. The so called Bazaar approach is such a dynamic market mechanism.

The WS-Agreement Negotiation standard describes concepts for such bilateral negotiations on Bazaar-based markets.

Considering I/O Processing in CloudSim for Performance and Energy Evaluation,"This article presents an extension of the IaaS Cloud simulator CloudSim. Our CloudSim extension takes into account the processing of i/o workload generated by virtual machines within a Data Center and evaluates the overall performance and energy consumption. Indeed, storage systems energy consumption may represent up to 40 % of the total energy consumed in a Data Center. Then, we propose three contributions. First, we modified the time computation model of CloudSim to consider i/o operations. Second, we designed several models of storage system devices including Hard Disk Drives and Solid-State Drives, and finally, we considered the cpu and ram used for i/o request processing. Our extensions have been evaluated using video encoding traces. First simulation results showed that a significant amount of energy, around 17 %, is consumed due to I/O workload execution, which shows the soundness of our CloudSim extensions.

CloudSim-A Survey on VM Management Techniques,"2 Abstract: With the initiation of internet in the 1990s to the present day facilities of universal computing, the internet has reformed the computing world in a drastic way. It has travelled from the concept of parallel computing to distributed computing to cluster computing to grid computing to utility computing to virtualization and recently to cloud computing, in future Internet of Things. Virtualization and utility computing can be stated as key concept of cloud. As cloud computing can be specified as a realization of utility computing. Although the idea of cloud computing has been around for quite some time, it is an evolving field of computer science. Since the evolution of cloud computing: Load balancing, energy management, VM migration, server consolidation, cost modelling and security issues are the popular research topic in this field. Deploying real cloud for testing or for commercial use is very costly. Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable and controllable manner under varying system and user configurations and requirements is difficult to accomplish. To overcome this challenge, cloud simulator is needed. In this paper basic of cloud simulator is discussed, and major focus is on cloudsim- a simulator for management of vm. The CloudSim toolkit supports both system and behaviour modeling of Cloud system components such as data centers, virtual machines (VMs) and resource provisioning policies. It implements generic application provisioning techniques that can be extended with ease and limited effort. Currently, it supports modeling and simulation of Cloud computing environments consisting of both single and inter-networked clouds (federation of clouds).

CloudSim: A fair benchmark for comparison of methods for times series reconstruction from cloud and atmospheric contamination,"Cloud contamination of optical data is a constant and annoying feature of time series analyses, whether while using vegetation indices or surface temperatures, since it tends to decrease artificially the values taken by these parameters. Therefore, any time series analysis of optical data needs a previous step for gap-filling reconstruction of the time series. Numerous techniques have been presented in the literature to carry out this preliminary and mandatory step. However, the evaluation and comparison of these techniques is difficult, since no “truth” time series is available. We present here a probabilistic model (CloudSim) to provide global typical annual time series for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and surface temperature (ST) time series (both over land and sea) with and without cloud contamination. This model takes advantage of the newly released Long Term Data Record Version 4 (LTDR-V4) dataset, by estimating at the pixel level daily probabilities of cloud presence, as well as mean and standard deviations for both cloud and clear acquisitions of daily NDVI and ST. Therefore, we can simulate real time series of cloud contamination influence on NDVI or ST parameters. These simulated time series allow for the assessment of the validity and usefulness of any time series reconstruction method, as well as an objective comparison of the efficiency of different methods.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0.2,1,,"José A.

MC-Sim: a mobile cloud simulation toolkit based on CloudSim,"Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has gained a significant attention these past years. MCC consists of migrating mobile applications from the constrained mobile devices to the cloud. This task is highly complicated and demanding, therefore several novel methods, tools, and approaches are introduced to tackle this complexity. At this point, we argue that a simulation of the deployment mechanisms for accessing cloud services and testing mobile cloud applications in the cloud environment is a mandatory phase prior to real deployment in a real environment. A simulation will offer the developer a controllable and cost-free environment to test and evaluate applications' performance according to different predefined scenarios.

Recovery based TPA in cloud for providing security to outsourced data using CloudSim,"Nowadays Cloud Computing became an inevitable thing in human's life. Both individual users and companies seek help of cloud for storing their data. When storing the data in the cloud user will have a fear about whether their data safe or not in cloud. So integrity of the data stored in the cloud is serious issue. To check the integrity of the data we propose a scheme that uses a trusted Third Party Auditor (TPA), who can verify the integrity of the data on demand.

Simulation of MapReduce Across Geographically Distributed Datacentres Using CloudSim,"Analysis of geo-distributed Big Data has been recently gaining importance. This is addressed either by copying data to a single data centre, or by processing data locally at each datacentre and aggregating the outputs at a single datacentre. Both involve expensive data transfers over wide area networks (WAN). In this work, we analyzed different models proposed for distributed MapReduce in various papers and selected a feasible model to simulate Map Reduce across distributed data centers. We have designed an extension to CloudSim and CloudSimEx to support three methods of implementing geo-distributed MapReduce.

Locality Sim: Cloud Simulator with Data Locality,"Cloud Computing (CC) is a model for enabling on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Testing and evaluating the performance of the cloud environment for allocating, provisioning, scheduling, and data allocation policy have great attention to be achieved. Therefore, using cloud simulator would save time and money, and provide a flexible environment to evaluate new research work. Unfortunately, the current simulators (e.g., CloudSim, NetworkCloudSim, GreenCloud, etc..) deal with the data as for size only without any consideration about the data allocation policy and locality. On the other hand, the NetworkCloudSim simulator is considered one of the most common used simulators because it includes different modules which support needed functions to a simulated cloud environment, and it could be extended to include new extra modules. According to work in this paper, the NetworkCloudSim simulator has been extended and modified to support data locality. The modified simulator is called LocalitySim. The accuracy of the proposed LocalitySim simulator has been proved by building a mathematical model.

This paper introduces and evaluates the effects of tax systems for IaaS markets which trade virtual machines. As a digital good with well defined characteristics like storage or processing power a virtual machine can be taxed by the tax authority using different tax systems. Currently the value added tax is widely used for taxing virtual machines only. The main contribution of the paper is the so called CloudTax component, a framework to simulate and evaluate different tax systems on service markets. It allows to introduce economical principles and phenomenons like the Laffer Curve or tax incidences.

Our evaluation highlighted the strengths and weakness of several MapReduce simulators. IoT-based applications, stream processing and replaying of production cluster workloads are key criteria absent from many simulators.

Multi-Cloud simulation environment for WebRTC streams,"Real-time streaming is becoming popular nowadays on the internet. WebRTC is a promising web technology that enables media stream transmission between two browsers without other third-party plugins. However, traditional WebRTC applications can only establish peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, which cannot be directly used in one-to-more streaming scenarios such as a multi-party video conference.

This thesis project presents a development of a multi-cloud simulation framework to implement software multicast of WebRTC streams to enable oneto-more real-time streaming. The framework can generate a cloud network topology with a simple script, and provides flexible ways to model the network links with parameters such as bandwidth, packet loss, and link latency. By using selective forwarding units (SFUs), a stream publisher only needs to send a single copy of the data to the cloud, the data packets are duplicated and forwarded to multiple subscribers. In addition, three resource allocation algorithms are included in the framework to determine the data center for a task.

To evaluate the performance, this framework enables people to monitor the throughputs and running streams on the data centers during the experiments. We develop benchmark applications as substitutes for real WebRTC traffic. These applications can generate UDP stream packets with the same dimension of WebRTC packets and provide the customization of stream parameters. In this report, we present a comparison of the stream performances under different allocation algorithms. Finally, as an outcome of this project, we design an integrated functional test to simulate a real-world scenario. The result shows that the framework is able to work well on complex real cases and simulate most of the multi-cloud networks.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,0,1,,Xiaodong Zhang,,2017,10.14257/ijhit.2017.10.8.06,,,,214

Cloud Simulation Model Based on Large Numbers Law for Evaluating Fault Tolerance Approaches,"Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that consists of hosting and delivering computing services across the web. The availability is one of the security features such as integrity and confidentiality. Certainly endorsing high availability by the improvement of fault tolerance techniques is one of the major concerns of the cloud. Elsewhere we cannot afford to directly evaluate new approaches for cost reason. For this reason we introduce in this paper a probabilistic model for simulation based on the principle of “Large Numbers Law”. The idea is to simulate a scenarios of cloud virtual environment in which faults can occur in a random way following failure occurrence probabilities. The global unavailability measured is faithful to unavailability average known of Cloud providers. The model allows live virtual machine migration in order to evaluate proactive fault tolerance approaches based on preemptive migration.

Load Evaluation on Cloud with Hybrid Technique using Cloudsim Simulator,: In distributed computing cloud computing is an emerging technology which provides pay per model as per user demand or requirement. Cloud has a collection of virtual machines which facilities both computational and storage requirement. Scheduling and Load balancing are the main challenges in the cloud computing on which we are emphasizing. Scheduling is the process to control the order of work going to be performed by computer system. Load balancing has an important role on the performance in cloud computing. Better load balancing will make cloud computing more efficient and will also increase the user satisfaction it provides a way to handle several inquiries residing inside cloud computing environment set. Complete balancing acquires two tasks one is resource provisioning/resource allocation and task scheduling throughout the system.

A CloudSim Extension for Evaluating Security Overhead in Workflow Execution in Clouds,"Workflow scheduling algorithms for cloud environments are extensively studied using workflow management system simulators. The common criteria covered by algorithms and addressed in simulators are makespan, monetary cost, reliability, and energy consumption. Beyond these criteria, security is also a criterion and has been investigated recently. Scientific and business workflows typically handle sensitive and big data that can influence the makespan and cost significantly when a scheduling algorithm applies security services to these data. However, simulators for workflow execution do not address the overhead produced by applying security services to sensitive data. In this paper, we propose an extension for workflow simulator to support security services. We considered seven steps for measuring security overheads on workflow execution. The extension was validated by executing a real-world workflow applying three types of security services namely authentication, integrity verification, and encryption. Our extension proved useful for simulating workflow execution applying security services on sensitive data and analyzing the effects of security on makespan, cost and security criteria.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"C.

Energy saving offloading scheme for mobile cloud computing using CloudSim,"In this paper, we accentuate on offloading for sparing energy in mobile cloud computing (MCC).

For heterogeneous cloud resources\nexperiencing vast dynamic changes in performance, a critical\nrole is played by the statistical characteristics of execution times,\nrelated to different cloud resources, to facilitate decision making\nin management. The cloud’s performance can be considerably\ninfluenced by the differences between the estimated and actual\nexecution times, which may affect the robustness of resource\nmanagement systems.\nLimitation exists in the study of cloud resource management\nsystems’ complexities even though extensive research has been\ndone on complexity issues in various fields from decision making\nin economics to computational biology.

Multiply-sectioned Bayesian network for multi-agent learning based meta resources scheduling in CloudSim,"The interest in Cloud Computing is growing significantly. This is for the application requirements to quickly access more resources to expand as needed. Collecting real time data about Cloud resources and finding the best fit resources to user requests are time and space consuming operation. Resources can be added/removed at any time and Cloud Computing System should utilize available resources and schedule user requests within specific time for execution. Considering such dynamic and complex domain, it is important to setup global policy among resources. The global policy can be applied through resources meta-scheduling. Multiply-Sectioned Bayesian Network (MSBN) provides a natural framework for such metaphor. We propose using adaptive Multi-Agent System (MAS) based on Multiply-Sectioned Bayesian Network (MSBN) for the function of meta-scheduling in Cloud Computing Systems. Random variables are representing the uncertainties in workload and resource's attributes. Each set of identical hosts in the Cloud System are grouped as subdomains, where set of agents have partial knowledge about the global system and local observations of hosts in the subdomain. Then, agents work to estimate the state of the local hosts and act accordingly to provide probability of assigning available resources to the user request. In addition, agents need to communicate their beliefs to other agents to improve the overall meta-scheduling performance. Agent with the strongest belief will get the request assigned for local resources scheduling and execution. If the agent failed to satisfy the request needs then the agent with the next strongest belief is assigned and so on. We present our proposed model by extending CloudSim simulation.

"Assessing Effects of Asymmetries, Dynamics, and Failures on a Cloud Simulator","We characterize the effects of asymmetries, dynamics, and failures when introduced into a cloud computing simulator, which had previously been characterized under static, homogeneous configurations with various patterns of demand and supply. We aim to determine whether injecting these new factors into the cloud simulator causes fundamental shifts in macroscopic behavior and user experience. We find that introducing asymmetries, dynamics, and failures into the cloud simulator does not induce fundamental shifts in the factors driving simulator behavior, but these new parameters do exhibit interactions with the main driving factors, and with each other. Our findings suggest that a previous study, using the cloud simulator to compare virtual-machine placement algorithms, need not be extended to consider the effects of asymmetries, dynamics, and failures.

Agent-based cloud simulation model for resource management,"Driven by the successful service model and growing demand, cloud computing has evolved from a moderate-sized data center consisting of homogeneous resources to a heterogeneous hyper-scale computing ecosystem. This evolution has made the modern cloud environment increasingly complex. Large-scale empirical studies of essential concepts such as resource allocation, virtual machine migration, and operational cost reduction have typically been conducted using simulations. This paper presents an agent-based cloud simulation model for resource management. The focus is on how service placement strategies, service migration, and server consolidation affect the overall performance of homogeneous and heterogeneous clouds, in terms of energy consumption, resource utilization, and violation of service-level agreements. The main cloud elements are modeled as autonomous agents whose properties are encapsulated. The complex relationships between components are realized through asynchronous agent-to-agent interactions. Operating states and statistics are displayed in real time. In the evaluation, the efficiency of the simulator is studied empirically. The performance of various resource management algorithms is assessed using statistical methods, and the accuracy of server energy consumption models is examined.

CloudSim Express: A Novel Framework for Rapid Low Code Simulation of Cloud Computing Environments,"Cloud computing environment simulators enable cost‐effective experimentation of novel infrastructure designs and management approaches by avoiding significant costs incurred from repetitive deployments in real Cloud platforms. However, widely used Cloud environment simulators compromise on usability due to complexities in design and configuration, along with the added overhead of programming language expertise. Existing approaches attempting to reduce this overhead, such as script‐based simulators and graphical user interface (GUI) based simulators, often compromise on the extensibility of the simulator. Simulator extensibility allows for customization at a fine‐grained level, thus reducing it significantly affects flexibility in creating simulations. To address these challenges, we propose an architectural framework to enable human‐readable script‐based simulations in existing Cloud environment simulators while minimizing the impact on simulator extensibility. We implement the proposed framework for the widely used Cloud environment simulator, the CloudSim toolkit, and compare it against state‐of‐the‐art baselines using a practical use case.

Their corresponding biomass are then calculated with allometric equations. We used the simulated tropical scenes (1000 samples) to test four classical machine learning models’ ability in biomass estimation from point clouds. Experimental results show that data augmentation is able to significantly boost test accuracy; self-supervised learning can improve the estimation results; among the four models, ResNet18 is the best baseline model which has achieved a R-square score of 0.6615, and reduced the root mean square error to 202 kg (mean biomass in our dataset is 2114kg).",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"Qian Song, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Yuanyuan Wang",,2023,10.1109/igarss52108.2023.10282570,IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,,,68
CloudSimSC: A Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Serverless Computing Environments,"Serverless computing is gaining traction as an attractive model for the deployment of a multitude of workloads in the cloud. Designing and building effective resource management solutions for any computing environment requires extensive long term testing, experimentation and analysis of the achieved performance metrics. Utilizing real test beds and serverless platforms for such experimentation work is often times not possible due to resource, time and cost constraints. Thus, employing simulators to model these environments is key to overcoming the challenge of examining the viability of such novel ideas for resource management. Existing simulation software developed for serverless environments lack generalizibility in terms of their architecture as well as the various aspects of resource management, where most are purely focused on modeling function performance under a specific platform architecture. In contrast, we have developed a serverless simulation model with induced flexibility in its architecture as well as the key resource management aspects of function scheduling and scaling. Further, we incorporate techniques for easily deriving monitoring metrics required for evaluating any implemented solutions by users. Our work is presented as CloudSimSC, a modular extension to CloudSim which is a simulator tool extensively used for modeling cloud environments by the research community. We discuss the implemented features in our simulation tool using multiple use cases.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"Anupama Mampage, R.

Research on the improvement of EdgeCloudSim's task scheduling framework,"In cloud-edge collaborative working mode, application services are affected by complex components, configuration and deployment conditions and other multi-dimensional factors. Therefore, it’s important to use simulation tools to conduct experiments reasonably and effectively. EdgeCloudSim is a simulation test platform widely used in edge computing. However, EdgeCloudSim's built-in task scheduling algorithm FF(First Fit) has problem of queuing and blocking, which makes some tasks fail to obtain computing resources in time. Besides, the processing time and load are not ideal. Another algorithm LL(Least load) optimizes above problems, but VM list needs to be traversed every time while scheduling. So the decision-making efficiency is low. Furthermore, EdgeCloudSim ignores migration cost of tasks. This paper improves the task scheduling framework of EdgeCloudSim for above problems and proposes a two-stage cloud-edge task scheduling strategy based on MH-LL(Max Heap-Least Load) algorithm and PP-LL(Position Probability-Least Load) algorithm. When resources of scheduled edge cloud are insufficient, task will be migrated to other edge clouds according to the migration cost calculated by distance factor α and distance coefficient d. Comparing with the original platform by experiments, the improved platform has an average optimization of 1.38%, 2.978s, 0.129s, and 19.26% in task failure rate, service time, delay, and load. It can improve work efficiency and system performance.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"Hua Lin, Xin Sui, Li Li, Dan Liu, Leilei Zhu",,2023,10.1117/12.2668027,International Conference on Electronic Information Engineering and Computer Science,,,66
Evaluate the Security Models Performances and Limitations of the Vehicular Network VANETcloudSim,"The Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) has been widely used to improve road safety and comfort. However, security is a big challenge for VANET, in fact, vehicle networks have the same security problems as traditional computer networks, hackers can introduce a dangerous threat to security. The issue of security in VANET networks has attracted a lot of attention from researchers to propose several security models. However, validation and performance testing of proposed solutions in a real or simulated environment remains a difficult problem. In this work, we present VANETcloudSim, it’s a new cloud platform simulator for VANET security solutions. The proposed simulator allows running stress and tests performance, In contrast to the majority of existing simulators, the proposed platform evaluates the performance and limitations of security models, through the execution of performance and stress tests, it is simple to deploy, robust and efficient.

A network migrating framework based on CloudSim,"With the continuous expansion of cloud data center scale, the flow of network traffic generated by virtual machine scheduling also increased, resulting in a sharp increase of energy consumption in cloud data center. Under certain network topology, different virtual machine scheduling strategies would produce different network flow. Therefore, how to optimize the scheduling strategy and reduce network flow became the key factors to reduce the energy consumption of cloud datacenter. In this paper, based on the cloud computing simulation platform CloudSim, the network module was extended, adding the network communication module of virtual machine migrating. In order to ensure the stability of the network data center, a virtual machine scheduling algorithm NPABFD for network traffic and energy consumption aware was proposed. The experimental results showed that the NPABFD algorithm could effectively reduce the transfer traffic of migrating VMs in high-level switches, reduce the global NDC's global energy consumption and the migrating number of VMs.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"Xin Sui, Li Li, Wen Song, Dan Liu, Leilei Zhu, Rui Liu",,2022,10.1117/12.2627859,Other Conferences,,,60
A Study on Energy-Aware Virtual Machine Consolidation Policies in Cloud Data Centers Using Cloudsim Toolkit,"In cloud computing, many data centers are used to serve the user’s service request and lead to high energy consumption. These vast data centers generate high carbon emissions in the environment and high operational costs for the cloud service provider. The method of reducing energy consumption by the data center is called Virtual Machine Consolidation (VMC). In VMC, one host’s migration to another saves energy by putting some hosts to sleep mode. There are four VMC methods: overload detection of the host, underload detection host, VM selection, and VM placement. VMC improves the utilization of energy consumption in data centers with maintain Quality of Service (QoS). Since VM consolidation is an important area for research, many researchers are working on it. In this article, we implement and execute the different twenty VMC policies using PlanetLab workload traces in the CloudSim toolkit and perform a comparative analysis of simulation results.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"D.

A Parallel Event System for Large-Scale Cloud Simulations in DISSECT-CF,"Discrete Event Simulation (DES) frameworks gained significant popularity to support and evaluate cloud computing environments. They support decision-making for complex scenarios, saving time and effort. The majority of these frameworks lack parallel execution. In spite being a sequential framework, DISSECT-CF introduced significant performance improvements when simulating Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. Even with these improvements over the state of the art sequential simulators, there are several scenarios (e.g., large scale Internet of Things or serverless computing systems) which DISSECT-CF would not simulate in a timely fashion. To remedy such scenarios this paper introduces parallel execution to its most abstract subsystem: the event system. The new event subsystem detects when multiple events occur at a specific time instance of the simulation and decides to execute them either on a parallel or a sequential fashion. This decision is mainly based on the number of independent events and the expected workload of a particular event. In our evaluation, we focused exclusively on time management scenarios. While we did so, we ensured the behaviour of the events should be equivalent to realistic, larger-scale simulation scenarios. This allowed us to understand the effects of parallelism on the whole framework, while we also shown the gains of the new system compared to the old sequential one. With regards to scaling, we observed it to be proportional to the number of cores in the utilised SMP host.",,Undecided,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"D.

Comparative Study On Cloud Computing Simulation Platforms,"Experimentation in a real environment is quite problem due to the high financial cost and the time required to accomplish it. Above all that, the tests are not repeatable, because many variables cannot be controlled with in the test, which may affect the results. Therefore, using simulation frameworks to evaluate cloud applications is preferred. It is extremely difficult to use real infrastructures for benchmarking the application performance (throughput, cost benefits) under inconstant conditions. Therefore, we cannot execute benchmarking experiments using real-world Cloud environments. To overcome this challenge, the use of simulation tool is the best applicable choice to the developers with substantial resources and parallelized execution. These simulation tools offer the researchers the chance to evaluate the hypothesis in a measured environment and simply emulate the output results.

Cloud Simulation and Virtualization for Testing of Critical Energy Infrastructure Components,"Cloud computing and cloud infrastructure are beginning to be applied in order to ensure effective functioning of management system of Critical Energy Infrastructure. This is improved informativeness of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system by the application of additional Wide-area Measurement and Control Systems (WAMCSs), since most of all processing and transition operations of data information streams of the WAMCSs may be performed by using on clouds. In light of these circumstances, it is importantly to get extensive modeling results considering wide area range of input data and latency time between critical energy infrastructure components and cloud infrastructure components. However, researchers were not, yet, had possibility to receive more adequate results based only mathematical modeling process. In this case, simulation models considering the cost time are more preferable than mathematical models. In the spirit development of this conception, authors are proposing to employ the simulation model based on virtual technology and Matlab Simulink toolkit in order to get modeling results for more important on-line mode of functioning of the WAMCSs.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"I.

Creating Cloud Simulations for Urban Logistics,"In the project USEfUL, simulations are used for the evaluation of novel logistics concepts, since realworld evaluations are very cost intensive. However, no simulation tool can provide a holistic solution to highdetail small-scale solution and low-detail large-scale simulation at the same time. To increase simulation capabilities, we enhanced two simulation tools, AnyLogic and MATSim, to run in lock step. This provides a single solution for different simulation needs. Furthermore, a jobbased simulation cloud was designed to reduce simulation costs while preserving data security. Simulation for urban logistics Currently urban logistics are changing, novel concepts taking hold in cities to reduce emissions and improve efficiency. At the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover, we are working with the city of Hannover and other institutions to explore the effects of novel logistics concepts on the current urban mobility. Within the project USEfUL [1], the project team evaluates multiple novel logistics concepts and presents the results in an easily understandable way to support decision making. Simulation models are used to reduce costs and avoid investing in concepts with adverse effects on the environment or the quality of life of residents. Two tools are used for the simulations, AnyLogic [2, 3] and MATSim [4], to simulate microscopic and macroscopic behavior respectively. AnyLogic is a commercially available multi-method simulation tool using a graphical modeling language in combination with snippets of java code. While allowing fine-grained modeling of individual agents, AnyLogic does not scale easily to city-scale populations. MATSim is a simulation framework purpose built for the simulation of large logistical scenarios, supporting a large amount of agents traversing a predefined road network. Published as an open-source Java library, MATSim can be easily extended with new modules, providing modeling support for e.g. trains. Within MATSim, agent behaviour is modeled through agent plans, containing a sequence of activities at certain locations and the routes the agents use to move from activity to activity. For the evaluation, research areas within the city of Hannover were defined. The research areas coincide with four districts of Hannover, which were selected as representation of the city as a whole. Selecting smaller parts of the city allows fine-grained simulation within the research area and reduces administrative burden if a certain concept is to be tested in practice. Within the project the following workflow has been established: First a baseline simulation is created, modeling the current state of traffic within Hannover. The baseline provides a current standard against which new logistics concepts can be evaluated. In the next step, changes in agent behaviour deriving from the logistical concept (e.g. online grocery shopping) are modeled within AnyLogic and simulated to evaluate the effects on activities and routes within the small-scale research areas [5]. Changes in activities and routes are then fed back into MATSim to evaluate the effects of the logistical concept on the entire city. Finally, all data is collected and evaluated to estimate the ecological and economic benefits and disadvantages of the concept. The simulations are run on office laptops and other consumer-grade hardware, as mobile working is often necessary in a cooperative project without a centralized office location. A cost-efficient service is therefore needed to provide easily usable computational resources for simulation. In the following we present our work on combining MATSim and AnyLogic into a joint simulation tool and constructing an automated platform to run simulations in a cost-efficient, privacy-conserving way. Section 1 will provide an overview of related works concerning the combination of AnyLogic and MATSim as well as cloud-based simulation solutions. In Section 2 we will describe the designed solution to run AnyLogic and MATSim in lock step, while Section 3 presents the ARGESIM Report 59 (ISBN 978-3-901608-93-3), p 427-432, DOI: 10.11128/arep.59.a59059",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"Richard Pump, Charline von Perbandt, Arne Koschel, Volker Ahlers",,2020,10.11128/arep.59.a59059,,,,39
GloudSim: Google trace based cloud simulator with virtual machines,"In 2011, Google released a 1‐month production trace with hundreds of thousands of jobs running across over 12,000 heterogeneous hosts. In order to perform in‐depth research based on the trace, it is necessary to construct a close‐to‐practice simulation system. In this paper, we devise a distributed cloud simulator (or toolkit) based on virtual machines, with three important features. (1) The dynamic changing resource amounts (such as CPU rate and memory size) consumed by the reproduced jobs can be emulated as closely as possible to the real values in the trace. (2) Various types of events (e.g., kill/evict event) can be emulated precisely based on the trace. (3) Our simulation toolkit is able to emulate more complex and useful cases beyond the original trace to adapt to various research demands. We evaluate the system on a real cluster environment with 16×8=128 cores and 112 virtual machines constructed by XEN hypervisor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reproduce Google cloud environment with real experimental system setting and real‐world large scale production trace. Experiments show that our simulation system could effectively reproduce the real checkpointing/restart events based on Google trace, by leveraging Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart tool. It can simultaneously process up to 1200 emulated Google jobs over the 112 virtual machines. Such a simulation toolkit has been released as a GNU GPL v3 software for free downloading, and it has been successfully applied to the fundamental research on the optimization of checkpoint intervals for Google tasks.

Performance and analysis of various fault-tolerant algorithms for cloud computing under CloudSim,"A fault is a procedure to make an obstacle for any sort of computing.

It has likewise been resolved that MIN-MIN calculation has the most minimal Average number of failed cloudlets and less fault tolerant is required in such calculation. Examinations of different fault tolerant calculations on the characterized parameters have been done to utilize appropriate asset usage with the most reduced an incentive from aggregate cost and execution time.

Multi-node Multi-agent Cloud Simulation: Approximating Synchronisation,"Traffic engineering is a key in effective utilisation of the road network infrastructure. Simulation assists traffic engineers making informed decisions on how to operate and direct traffic within the road networks. These simulations are complex, generate big data and require high-powered computers, which can process information faster than real time, to ensure the results can be used to affect traffic. Cloud computing, a relatively new technology paradigm, can meet the essential requirements, such as scalability, interoperability, availability and high-end performance. In this paper, a novel approach to a synchronisation strategy of large-scale complex simulations is proposed. This approach builds upon advancements achieved in distributed computing. The new synchronisation strategy is designed to allow different granularities of synchronisation accuracy. Through this strategy, synchronisation overhead is reduced, thus allowing the computing bandwidth to be applied to simulation performance increases as a result of the trade off between synchronisation accuracy and performance.",,Rejected,Abstract Screening,0,1,,"Antonio Giardina, H.

A two-stage stochastic model for cloud computing simulation of resource efficiency cost analysis,"Cloud computing has changed the traditional way of the Internet resource provision into the pay-per-use, but how to evaluate the performance and the Quality of service(QoS) by using simulation tool is a complex problem given the limits of physical resource.

To demonstrate the validity of the model, an example of the minimum resource for QoS guaranteeing search (MROGS) algorithm which can search the suitable threshold of resource size is given.

Colza: Enabling Elastic In Situ Visualization for High-performance Computing Simulations,"In situ analysis and visualization have grown increasingly popular for enabling direct access to data from high-performance computing (HPC) simulations. As a simulation progresses and interesting physical phenomena emerge, however, the data produced may become increasingly complex, and users may need to dynamically change the type and scale of in situ analysis tasks being carried out and consequently adapt the amount of resources allocated to such tasks. To date, none of the production in situ analysis frameworks offer such an elasticity feature, and for good reason: the assumption that the number of processes could vary during run time would force developers to rethink software and algorithms at every level of the in situ analysis stack. In this paper we present Colza, a data staging service with elastic in situ visualization capabilities. Colza relies on the widely used ParaView Catalyst in situ visualization framework and enables elasticity by replacing MPI with a custom collective communication library based on the Mochi suite of libraries.

EDISON: A Web-Based HPC Simulation Execution Framework for Large-Scale Scientific Computing Software,"Computational science and engineering (CSE) researchers usually develop their own technology computer-aided design (TCAD) programs, accompanying large-scale computation and I/O on high-performance computing (HPC) resources like clusters or supercomputers. The researchers typically use command-line interface (CLI) such as Terminal to access the HPC resources. But CLI may not be a useful tool to those who conduct research or get educated with the TCAD software, because of their unfamiliarity with executing a series of commands. Thus there has been a strong need on a platform that assists domain-specific scientists to easily share, access, and run TCAD services. To satisfy the need, in this poster we present a novel cyber-environment, called ""Education-research Integration through Simulation On the Net"" (EDISON), which has been designed and implemented to access and run various TCAD software tools developed in five selected CSE fields over the past four years. The EDISON platform comprises three layers: application portal to browse and run TCAD software, middleware to manage metadata associated with TCAD software and handle online simulation jobs, and infrastructure to support network, storage, and computing resources. In this demo a user will interact with the EDISON platform to perform two representative use-case scenarios: 1) browsing various TCAD tools, selecting one of the tools, controlling with its parameters, and running a simulation job from the tool, and 2) constructing a scientific workflow of selected TCAD tools and executing the workflow.

An improved model for live migration in data centre simulators,"Due to the difficulty of employing real data centres' infrastructure for assessing the effectiveness of energy-aware algorithms, many researchers resort on using Cloud simulators.

Nested Workflows for Loosely Coupled HPC Simulations,"The increasing complexity of modern scientific simulations has given rise to the notion of re-usability as a means to reduce development time and effort. One form of re-usability involves hierarchical modelling, where the code and artifacts that model a physical phenomenon are used as the building blocks for more complex coupled physical systems. This reusability mode allows for improvements in constituents sub-models to impact the overall fidelity of the entire system with minimal effort. This benefit, however, hinges upon the ability to provide a fairly loose coupling across model boundaries, where changes in any sub-model do not result in wholesale changes to other sub-models, or in the structure and details of the code for the entire physical system. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and case studies for incorporating sub-workflows as building blocks in a framework for loosely coupled high performance simulations. We outline the issues involved in providing lightweight customization points for full workflows that allows their use unchanged in a nested-workflow setting, while providing each sub-workflow with a separate execution context that ensures non-interference with other parts of the simulation. We present several use cases that demonstrate the successful use of the proposed design and its flexibility in accommodating different customization and scaling requirements.",,Rejected,Score-based Screening,0.666667,0,,"M.

Towards Exascale: Measuring the Energy Footprint of Astrophysics HPC Simulations,"The increasing amount of data produced in Astronomy by observational studies and the size of theoretical problems to be tackled in the next future pushes the need of HPC (High Performance Computing) resources towards the ""Exascale"". The HPC sector is undergoing a profound phase of transition, in which one of the toughest challenges to cope with is the energy efficiency that is one of the main blocking factors to the achievement of ""Exascale"". Since ideal peak-performance is unlikely to be achieved in realistic scenarios, the aim of this work is to give some insights about the energy consumption of contemporary architectures with real scientific applications in a HPC context. We use two state-of-the-art applications from the astrophysical domain, that we optimized in order to fully exploit the underlying hardware: a direct N-body code and a semi-analytical code for Cosmic Structure formation simulations. For these two applications, we quantitatively evaluate the impact of computation on the energy consumption when running on three different systems: one that represents the present of current HPC systems (an Intel-based cluster), one that (possibly) represents the future of HPC systems (a prototype of an Exascale supercomputer) and a micro-cluster based on Arm MPSoC. We provide a comparison of the time-to-solution, energy-to-solution and energy delay product (EDP) metrics, for different software configurations. ARM-based HPC systems have lower energy consumption albeit running ≈10 times slower.",,Rejected,Score-based Screening,0.5,0,,"M. Katevenis, L. Tornatore, G. Perna, I. Coretti, D.

High performance computing simulator for the performance assessment of trajectory based operations,"High performance computing (HPC), both at hardware and software level, has demonstrated significant improve- \nments in processing large datasets in a timely manner. However, HPC in the field of air traffic management (ATM) can be much more than only a time reducing tool. It could also be used to build an ATM simulator in which distributed scenarios where decentralized elements (airspace users) interact through a centralized manager in order to generate a trajectory-optimized conflict-free scenario. In this work, we introduce an early prototype of an ATM simulator, focusing on air traffic flow management at strategic, pre-tactical and tactical levels, which allows the calculation of safety and efficiency indicators for optimized trajectories, both at individual and network level. The software architecture of the simulator, relying on a HPC cluster of computers, has been preliminary tested with a set of flights whose trajectory vertical profiles have been optimized according to two different concepts of operations: conventional cruise operations (i.e. flying at constant altitudes and according to the flight levels scheme rules) and continuous climb cruise operations (i.e., optimizing the trajectories with no vertical constraints). The novel ATM simulator has been tested to show preliminary benchmarking results between these two concepts of operations. The simulator here presented can contribute as a testbed to evaluate the potential benefits of future Trajectory Based Operations and to understand the complex relationships among the different ATM key performance areas",,Rejected,Score-based Screening,0.444444,0,,"Xavier Prats Menéndez, R.

Exploiting Spark for HPC Simulation Data: Taming the Ephemeral Data Explosion,"In this paper, we address the challenge of analyzing simulation data on HPC systems by using Apache Spark, which is a Big Data framework. One of the main problems we encountered with using Spark on HPC systems is the ephemeral data explosion, which is brought about by the curse of persistence in the Spark framework. Data persistence is essential in reducing I/O, but it comes at the cost of storage space. We show that in some cases, Spark scratch data can consume an order of magnitude more space than the input data being analyzed, leading to fatal out-of-disk errors. We investigate the real-world application of scaling machine learning algorithms to predict and analyze failures in multi-physics simulations on 76TB of data (over one trillion training examples). This problem is 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than prior work. Based on extensive experiments at scale, we provide several concrete recommendations as state-of-the-practice, and demonstrate a 7x reduction in disk utilization with negligible increases or even decreases in runtime.",,Rejected,Score-based Screening,0.4,0,,"G.

BeatBox—HPC simulation environment for biophysically and anatomically realistic cardiac electrophysiology,"The BeatBox simulation environment combines flexible script language user interface with the robust computational tools, in order to setup cardiac electrophysiology in-silico experiments without re-coding at low-level, so that cell excitation, tissue/anatomy models, stimulation protocols may be included into a BeatBox script, and simulation run either sequentially or in parallel (MPI) without re-compilation.

"An approach to increase reliability of HPC simulation, application to the Gysela5D code","Reproducibility of results is a strong requirement in most fields of research for experimental results to be called science. For results obtained through simulation software using high performance computing (HPC) this translates as code quality requirements. While there are many works focusing on software quality, these typically do not take the specificities of HPC scientific simulation software into account. This paper presents an approach to introduce quality procedures in HPC scientific simulation software while remaining the less invasive as possible so as to ease its adoption. The approach relies on quality procedures including human code review and automated testing and offers a dedicated procedure to help correct defects found this way. These procedures are integrated in a development work-flow designed to improve the traceability of defects. By implementing this approach for the development of the Gysela code, we show that it is indeed viable and that the return on investment is positive. We also identify multiple reusable elements developed for this experiment that should reduce the cost of adopting the approach for other codes as well as some aspects that can still be improved to ensure a widespread propagation of the approach in the community.",,Rejected,Score-based Screening,0.222222,0,,"Julien Bigot, Grandgirard, Chantal Passeron, F.

Bringing OptoBoards to HPC-scale environments: An OptoHPC simulation engine,"The increased communication bandwidth demands of HPC-systems calling at the same time for reduced latency and increased power efficiency have designated optical interconnects as the key technology in order to achieve the target of exascale performance.

Dense agent-based HPC simulation of cell physics and signaling with real-time user interactions,"Introduction Distributed simulations of complex systems to date have focused on scalability and correctness rather than interactive visualization. Interactive visual simulations have particular advantages for exploring emergent behaviors of complex systems. Interpretation of simulations of complex systems such as cancer cell tumors is a challenge and can be greatly assisted by using “built-in” real-time user interaction and subsequent visualization. Methods We explore this approach using a multi-scale model which couples a cell physics model with a cell signaling model. This paper presents a novel communication protocol for real-time user interaction and visualization with a large-scale distributed simulation with minimal impact on performance. Specifically, we explore how optimistic synchronization can be used to enable real-time user interaction and visualization in a densely packed parallel agent-based simulation, whilst maintaining scalability and determinism. We also describe the software framework created and the distribution strategy for the models utilized. The key features of the High-Performance Computing (HPC) simulation that were evaluated are scalability, deterministic verification, speed of real-time user interactions, and deadlock avoidance. Results We use two commodity HPC systems, ARCHER (118,080 CPU cores) and ARCHER2 (750,080 CPU cores), where we simulate up to 256 million agents (one million cells) using up to 21,953 computational cores and record a response time overhead of ≃350 ms from the issued user events. Discussion The approach is viable and can be used to underpin transformative technologies offering immersive simulations such as Digital Twins. The framework explained in this paper is not limited to the models used and can be adapted to systems biology models that use similar standards (physics models using agent-based interactions, and signaling pathways using SBML) and other interactive distributed simulations.",,Rejected,Score-based Screening,0,0,,"N.C.

SmartSim is a library dedicated to enabling online analysis and Machine Learning (ML) for traditional HPC simulations. In this paper, we detail the SmartSim architecture and provide benchmarks including online inference with a shared ML model on heterogeneous HPC systems. We demonstrate the capability of SmartSim by using it to run a 12-member ensemble of global-scale, high-resolution ocean simulations, each spanning 19 compute nodes, all communicating with the same ML architecture at each simulation timestep. In total, 970 billion inferences are collectively served by running the ensemble for a total of 120 simulated years.

Interactive Visualization and Analysis of High Resolution HPC Simulation Data on a Laptop With VTK,"We present a highly efficient solution to interact with the Deep Water Impact Ensemble Data Set provided for the Scientific Visualization Contest 2018. Interactive visualization is made possible on one core of a laptop with the full resolution and the same accuracy as in the original data set, when originally 256 up to 2048 supercomputer nodes were required to generate the data. As far as we know this is the only way to achieve full-resolution exploration on a laptop. We first expose how our approach allows more efficient visualization by using the Tree-Based Adaptive Mesh Refinement grid data structure we introduced in VTK, vtkHyperTreeGrid [1], as compared to structured or unstructured approaches. Then we elaborate on the visualization capabilities offered by vtkHyperTreeGrid-optimized algorithms and the performance achieved on the limited resources available on a laptop.

"End-to-End Workflows for Climate Science: Integrating HPC Simulations, Big Data Processing, and Machine Learning","Current scientific workflow systems do not typically integrate simulation-centric and data-centric aspects due to their very different software/infrastructure requirements.

This work presents a complex case study related to extreme events analysis of future climate data that integrates in the same workflow numerical simulations, Big Data analytics and Machine Learning models. The case study is being implemented in the context of the eFlows4HPC project using the project’s software stack for deployment and orchestration of the workflow.

High Performance Computing Simulation of Intelligent Logistics Management Based on Shortest Path Algorithm,"At present, e-commerce drives the logistics industry to develop greatly, but at the same time, there is a huge demand in this field, such as lower cost and higher efficiency. Facing the needs of logistics management development, it needs the blessing of intelligent technology, which involves countless fields at present. Intelligent logistics management has become a hot spot at present. What needs to be solved in this respect is how to shorten the transportation distance and save costs. To solve this problem, this paper proposes to introduce the shortest path algorithm. This paper compares the Dijkstra algorithm with the A∗ algorithm under the background of logistics management and finds that the latter is more suitable for this field with huge amount of information. In order to improve the performance of the A∗ algorithm, this paper introduces ant colony algorithm, which can better avoid obstacles. Combining these two algorithms, a ∗-ant colony algorithm is obtained. The algorithm absorbs the advantages of the two algorithms, while maintaining high efficiency and good stability. These characteristics are very satisfying in the field of logistics management.

Low-Cost Post Hoc Reconstruction of HPC Simulations at Full Resolution,"High performance computing has played a pivotal and ongoing role in the field of computational fluid dynamics, enabling the simulation of increasingly larger-scale models. However, this rapid growth in model and simulation size has outpaced the capabilities of input/output (I/O) operations. Consequently, the conventional approach of saving and outputting data to persistent storage for analysis has become increasingly challenging, limiting the benefits of these advanced models. To address this challenge, we present a method for effectively handling massive-scale simulation data, ensuring its persistence at full spatial and temporal resolution for flexible post hoc analysis. We employ an in situ approach that captures interprocess communicated data, compressing cached data to a fraction of the overall simulation domain. We successfully reconstruct subdomains at full spatial and temporal resolution during post-processing through communication-free rerun using the cached halos. We detail the storage requirements of the new approach and demonstrate the substantial reductions in computational resources required to precisely recapitulate data within a local region of interest.",,Rejected,Score-based Screening,0,0,,"Ayman Z.
